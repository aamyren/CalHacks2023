Yes, opening up their network to others will help, but this is also another revenue stream for Tesla too. \n\nTesla has building EVs at scale in a profitable manner down very well & have battery supply issues solved more than anyone. They have a lot of pricing flexibility.\n\nTheir buying process is more appealing to anyone under 60.\n\nThe bad:\n\nEV competition is heating up, with more options, people no longer have to buy a Tesla if they want an EV. The overall EV pie may continue to grow, but I see their piece shrinking.\n\nMusk\u2019s association is a turn off to some potential buyers\n\nUnless the cyber truck has something spectacular that\u2019s been kept under wraps, they\u2019ve waited too long to enter the truck market segment with an odd design that lacks mass appeal\n\nActual full self driving remains a pipe dream \n\nTheir lead in tech in general is rapidly shrinking as they\u2019ve basically not innovated much of anything for years. \n\nLastly, yes, while I believe they will continue to do well as a car company, there\u2019s no reason for the stock to ballon back to previous levels either as their is no \u2018wow\u2019 factor there anymore nor any on the horizon."

Even in the most absurdly bullish case possible Tesla was never going to maintain a 72.7% share of the EV market in California.\n\nThe better metrics to look at are 1) how many vehicles are Tesla selling in California, and 2) what's their market share in the total California Auto Market?\n\nThink of it this way,  Apple was the first company to sell smartphones, so they once controlled 100% of that market segment. Does the fact that Apple now only controls a fraction of the global smartphone sales today because other companies jumped into the smartphone market mean that Apple was a terrible investment? No of course not, Apple is selling more smartphones then they ever were back when they controlled 100% of the smartphone market."

     "Would think so. \n\nHAving done some sums, I don't think the truck is actually all that special. For example, Volvo's Class 8 EV truck the VNR, it its top form has a 565 kWh battery and a claimed 275 mi range. So it's about 2 kWh/mi or thereabouts. Tesla are claiming 500 mi? 2 kWh/mi?  So I think they're not really ahead in terms of efficiency or anything, but would seem to have a lead on packaging. For their claim they need about twice the battery and I guess a clean-sheet design would allow them to package that in better than the old guard.\n\nThe real meat is whether they've made something that, in 500,000 miles, still works great. They're not known for building particularly high quality cars are they. That kind of performance will not wash in the heavy duty market. It just won't.\n\nAs an aside, I didn't realise, but it seem Volvo have quite the range of applications for their EV trucks. They have a pretty wide offering!"

The stock is very overpriced and this information is irrelevant as it fails to justify the high market cap and and high multiples. The share value is based on both the actual growth and innovation as a company as well as \u201cirrational exuberance\u201d for future prospects that are difficult to justify. It often seems that the stock, itself, is more acting as a catch- all for electric vehicle investment.\n\n2. Regardless of the intrinsic value of the stock, positive news like this will cause positive investor sentiment. The price is already wildly high so it\u2019s very possible that any bit of optimistic view will continue to push it up (at least, to a point.)\n\nNot knowing the future the company could be undervalued for all I know. I tend to think the high price isn\u2019t justified, but again, we\u2019re all just going off our best estimates. I tend to think that the price is unreasonable and unsustainable, but regardless of that news and sentiment can keep stock prices unreasonable for unreasonable periods of time."

     "I find it so funny, there a few people who got defensive (few weeks ago) and started telling that me \u201cTesla is the best car manufacturer\u201d better than any legacy manufacturer \u201cthe have the highest profits\u201d \u201cand Tesla isn\u2019t just a car manufacturer it\u2019s actually a robotics company\u201d and I was sort of agreeing with them, but I was emphasizing that Tesla is garbage company for a stock holder\u2026 \n\nThey just kept on defending Elon, calling him a \u201cgenius\u201d\u2026 they just couldn\u2019t accept fact that Elon is a moron harming Tesla\u2019s credibility both in its company valuation and its shareholders\u2026 \n\nTesla hasn\u2019t even hit bottom yet\u2026 I\u2019m glad I went with Bill Gates investment strategy on getting puts on the downfall of Tesla\u2026 \n\nI wanna match it burn to the ground, literally the stupidest car they have manufactured is the Model X\u2026 ugly ass brid wing doors, u can\u2019t even open that shit in your garage without causing any damage\u2026 that\u2019s another people thing get defensive about\u2026 \n\nTesla honestly is just too plain and simple in design compared to all the others car companies, majority of legacy automakers have already released EV\u2019s or some sort of hybrid models\u2026 and they all look better than Tesla (in my opinion). I personally like the Jaguar I-PACE and Mustang Mach-E over the Tesla (brid car) Model X\u2026\n\nPlus Tesla doesn\u2019t even feel exclusive or luxurious anymore bc you\u2019ll notice every mofo looking douchey as fuck in their Tesla\u2026 (I am Asian in the Chicago suburbs) and legit every brown motherfucker has that car here and they just look so full of themselves, I did a test drive at a dealership once in the model X and I just felt awkward and grossed out driving it\u2026 (I could just feel the douchynes vibes flowing off of me)\u2026 I\u2019m glad in the end we opted out to get Audi Q4 E-Tron"

Then again, major events such as this speech can very easily blow past technical analysis probabilities...so we shall see.  Either way, from a swing trading perpective the volatility remains high, which is resulting in continued opportunites on both the long & short side.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**SPY:**  Index continues to 'lag' slightly behind the others.  Price traded generally within range from the previous 3x candles; bullish consolidation could be forming just beneath the major resistance TL, which is only weakening this TL the more it consolidations.

     "\"The two most plentiful things in the universe are: hydrogen and stupidity.\" Harlan Ellison\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm a machinist currently making some isolation valves for a company that is putting them on the purge side of a hydrogen fuel cell.  They have done some testing in Europe and Canada with it.  The testing of the valve in their commercial buses has been on-going for a couple of years now since I made the first prototypes.  The company itself has a good way of extracting hydrocarbons from defunct oil wells and separating the molecules for fuel.  They have already started building some refueling infrastructure in some European countries.  \n\nBut I have to agree that Hydrogen, in spite of it's incredible volatility, is a much better \"green\" alternative to EV's for the simple fact that the folks in Africa don't have to mine the minerals, for a pittance, that are needed for the batteries.  There's not so much damage being done to the earth to bring those minerals out and process them.  There's no waste involved when the battery dies and needs replacement, but the replacement battery costs more than just buying a new car (I believe we're already headed in that direction)."

Acting like electricity won't be a part of transportation is simply naive.\n\nAt the same time we can utilize extra energy from grid production specifically to not only provide desalination at coastal regions but also to perform electrolysis to make H2. Not only for energy storage but also potentially municipal supply. Acting like H2 won't inundate almost every industry that involves heat or motion would also be naive. \n\nThe redundancy that comes from utilizing both systems, and both systems being generated from renewable resources, is something that can't be overlooked. You're on a region with no H2? Just plug in. No charging around you? Fill up with municipal H2.\n\nI personally foresee house heating, cooking, transportation, and even long term energy storage being based on H2 and battery tech, all off the back of booming solar production. \n\nEven just looking at my situation directly, I spend about $300/mo on gas... looking at an EV and the cost would be about $40/mo in electricity. They are simply better. If I could hybridized that with H2 and get that redundancy and peace of mind I absolutely would."

     "This video almost gave me cancer. It's biased and utterly promotional and fails to explain the main drawbacks that still prevent this from being viable:\n\n1. As abundant as hydrogen is in the universe, it does not exist in pure form on Earth, which means it must first be separated out. Separating it always takes more energy than you will get back from the resultant fuel. So this means you will have to cover the cost of the energy used to create it. That's before you account for any of the energy used for compression and storage.\n\n2. Once you've got hydrogen you are better off using it in a fuel cell as this provides the best conversion to useful energy and ultimately work. But even this process can lose substantial amounts of energy (way more than a battery). A combustion engine with hydrogen is a stupid idea as it would reduce the well to wheel efficiency tremendously.\n\n3. The cost of all these components and new infrastructure for refueling is way way higher than an equivalent electric-only fleet.\n\n4. H2 cars have their own unique rare material requirements, especially for components in the fuel cell catalyst making them extremely expensive.\n\nSeriously this is some absolute dumb shit. They are designing to alleviate a single thing about electric cars (slightly slow charge times). But in the process they are creating a system that is way worse in every single way.\n\nWho wants to pay more per mile in extra fuel costs?\nWho wants to be beholden to the price of hydrogen at a pump instead of generating your own electricity at home with solar?\nWho wants to pay an excessive amount for H2 cars that are significantly more expensive and don't offer significantly more range?\nWho wants to have a car that retains the hundreds and hundreds of moving parts and maintenance requirements instead of going electric and saving on all that?\nWho wants to have a noisy car?\nWho wants to have a car that's less performant then an electric equivalent?\n\nIf that who is you then you're either in the gas/oil/car-dealership industry or an idiot."

It seems great for larger engines like cargo freighters and cruise ships.\n\nRight now EV are coming on strong and have the benefits of using existing infrastructure and greatly reduced vehicle maintenance requirements. Electric motors have a huge benefit over an engine that uses exploding gases and many parts that require constant lubrication. \n\nAmprius Technologies has started producing - meaning selling - lightweight silicone lithium batteries that have a faster charge ability and hold more than the normal batteries available in current EV. These batteries address range anxiety and charging time, meaning these have a lot higher density, and charge from 0-80% in 6 minutes. These new batteries are being used in high performance aircraft and drones. Once these type of batteries become more readily available EV ranges will increase by almost double. And you'll be able to recharge in a similar time it now takes to fill up your ICE vehicle \n\nI'm excited about hydrogen and see the innovations as proof that corporate stagnation has started to diminish. We have to try a lot of stuff in order to get away from our dependence on burning fossil fuels. And for those who say electricity comes from fossil fuels at generating plants: it's a lot easier to condition the outflow from one smokestack than thousands of tailpipes."

I believe that EVs will be the long term solution with Solar or renewables charging the batteries and the fuel stations of today will be modified to just switch the batteries on a car. Remove the empty charge with a battery that\u2019s fully charged using renewables. This will take less time that charging the empty battery. I also believe this to be applicable for trucks and heavy vehicles as well. Planes will be using sustainable fuels which have been demonstrated successfully already. \n\nI don\u2019t see a future for hydrogen due to several good points raised by many people here, mainly due to low energy density, transportation issues via ammonia and the costs involved, etc. Anything with low energy density can not be a suitable candidate for fuel. Hydrogen being such a small molecule there will be leaks and accidents which will scare people away just like many are with Nuclear power.

Those with EVs will say it's not a problem, but we all know its a hassle they could do without \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nSolution is a) obvious one, batteries that will do 500/600  miles, with constant usage of lights, heater, window wipers, heated seats, etc... included in that figure. \nb) Infrastructure - if you do need to charge up, ensure there's plenty of chargers to go round. Currently, the lack of infrastructure leads people back to ICE vehicles......\n\nc) EV manufacturers agree to have the same battery connections and  make EV battery stations, where you or a station worker (new jobs in communities too) will swap out the battery for a fully charged one in 5 minutes. It's feasible. Fuel stations are already built , so they'd only need to adapt for this service, Technologies are already there that changes the batteries in Fork lift trucks, reach trucks, and hi level order pickers. It could easily be adapted to EVs on the road, they could even automate it to reduce human error.\n\nThis would give the EV industry another 20 years, and in that time, hydrogen is ready to be mass transported and cost effective to put into vehicles. \n\nHaving typed all this, I feel its wasted in this forum \ud83d\ude48"

     "Just a side comment. I recently wrote a paper on EVs and what a lie it is. For starters, there's a finite amount of known lithium sources. If any new mines develop, it takes around 15 years to get to the usable lithium. Everyone (govt, car CEOs, etc.) knows that there isn't enough lithium to make the EVs needed to reach net zero by 2050. A ton of other electronics need lithium batteries too. The idea fails again because people that bought EVs early and mid trend will need a new battery for their vehicle or buy a new EV...so again, not nearly enough lithium to supply that. Then we'd spend a bunch of money making the grids able to handle the new electricity that's needed only to run out of lithium a few years down the road and have EVs that would then be paperweights. It doesn't take much digging at all to find that everyone pushing this EV idea is invested in it. So they'll be set for life $$$, even after the movement fails. It's a giant money grab and all it really is, is selling a feeling like you're saving the environment, when in fact it's a drop in the ocean. ICE pollution makes up like 20% of air pollution...that's ALL the trains, boats, planes, 18 wheelers, passenger vehicles, motorcycles, etc. Passenger vehicles are something like 60% of that...so replacing every passenger vehicle in the world with an electric version would make about a 10% change, worldwide...so it's not the earth saving concept they'd have you believe it is. \n\nI'm not saying let's just give up on the planet. We do need to develop clean energy. We need to let it grow naturally though. The ICE didn't get this advanced over a few years...it's taken over 100 years to get here. We definitely should not put all our eggs in one basket with the EV movement. It's just another way the elite will screw the American people out of their hard earned money."

     "Dude, this is a terrible conclusion to draw. I get it, but you're trying to draw a linear relationship where one doesn't exist.\n\nWhen insiders sell large amounts of shares, they use a process called VWAP. The broker will just sell small amounts of shares throughout the day so that it moves the price as minimally as possible. That's why it'll take him 2 weeks to sell, because the amount of shares to be sold is much higher than the average daily volume.\n\nAs a result, Musk's sales have probably had a minimal effect on TSLA price. What has affected the price is everyone else selling BECAUSE he's selling. And now the fact that he's selling is no longer news. So TSLA might drop more, but unless more negative news comes out, the drop might not be sharp. It could also rebound and kill you if you short. So be very careful shorting anything."

Q4 deliveries are usually the best of the year. Tesla will continue breaking records every quarter and will have 2 huge factories ramping up next year. Q1 and Q2 margins will suffer a bit but Tesla learned a lot from their China factory. By the end of next year we could see Tesla at $2000+. Dojo will be completed and will start training the NN next year as well which should increase the rate of improvement for FSD significantly.

     "Best advice I could give you is to not beat yourself up too much. Everyone gets carried away with the market at some point.\n\nIf I was you, and I wasn't trading on borrowed money, I would take the hit on the chin and accept that you fucked up but it cant really get much worse than it is at present. Hell, some of the stocks are at levels that could be pretty good buy points. But some also aren't. I would just stop looking at them for a couple of months.\n\nUse the break to invest in yourself. Learn some basic TA, which can help you to not step on so many landmines. Look at a simple Bollinger band. 20 period. If the monthly close price isn't above the center line and the line isn't trending up then the stock isn't something you should be investing in. Simple momentum. There's plenty of other TA if you want to get a bit trickier. Just remember to KISS. And don't take advice on individual stocks from anyone. How do you know they aren't looking to unload their stocks onto you....  Best of luck."

Before the pandemic, a number of these stocks were great medium to long term performers while Tesla\u2019s balance sheet issues were sufficient enough to cause people to cast doubt on its future as a public company. \n\nYou have 2 major issues. One is understanding why you own certain names. For example, relative to 2020-21 when nearly everyone was wfh, will there be more usage of zoom\u2019s core product in 2023? How can online dating grow on top of pandemic numbers as people continue to go out in person? The second issue is duplication. There\u2019s no reason to own tsm and intc, bmbl and mtch, cloudflare and crowdstrike, etc at the same time. Pick one and keep it moving. \n\nImo some of these names will come back in 5 years. Others won\u2019t. Therefore do a whittling down process to eliminate duplication, get rid of 1/2-2/3 of the portfolio, and keep ko and tsla."

Dollar-cost averaging that to a lower cost basis is going to take ages with little certainty for the future or reward. \n\nIf you really want to pick individual stocks some tips: check if companies actually make money, check if they are in a hype bubble (like AI now the new big thing is, but Blockchain had that spot a few years ago), and switch up your choices of industry. \n\nOr just yolo it all on 0DTE option gambles and become a prized member of the WSB wall of shame.\n\nAlso do your own research and don't follow what Reddit says too much."

Would that count as 4 trades and be flagged for de activated? Or because its not the same stock im fine with 2 trades on spy and 2 trades on TSLA?\\n\\nI know I dont understand this concept good enough and people might bash me but Im just trying to get a answer here not a lecture thanks'",

Most brokerages don\u2019t let you do more than 3 day trades in a given amount of time, meaning you can\u2019t buy and sell a position (a stock) in the same day.\n\nIf your buy TSLA at 9am then sell it at 1pm that would be 1 day trade.\n\nIdk for sure I would need to know what brokerage this is and what restrictions they place on its traders. There shouldn\u2019t be any restrictions on simply on how many trades you make other than day trades.

More than double. \n\nThey are opening new plants/factories in multiple locations all over the world. Telsa will produce over 2 million vehicles in 2024. \n\nIn comparison, every other company that produces EV cars or trucks produced about 20k each. That\u2019s per company. \n\nThere isn\u2019t a company that can produce at Tesla\u2019s speed. Ford has a backlog of 200k orders and in their estimate it\u2019s going to take about 3 years to fulfill them. That\u2019s 200/3= at most 70k trucks per year. And that\u2019s a lot compared to most other EV companies. Lucid, ruvian, ford, BYD, Porsche, GM produce 20k or less per year. Think about that. In 2023 Tesla will produce over a million car!! And every year that number goes up significantly. \n\nI know you are concerned with the price cuts. But think about this for a second. If every body buys a Tesla, they are not buying any other car. \n\nTesla can saturate the market and then they own that customer for years to come. Average car is owned for 14 years.

And for the time being Tesla seems to have been able to deal with supply chain issues.\n\n\nThe biggest risk is probably central banks / feds being trigger happy. And / or trade disputes could reignite with China and limit teslas ability to push into the Chinese market. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve taken some gains and limited my exposure to ETFs that have opted to include Tesla.\n\nGood luck!"

The point I\u2019m making is that TSLA is very different to many of the other companies you mention, it is important to know what you\u2019re investing in and what your expectations /  scenarios were for your investment, and to adjust your decision as to whether to invest and how much.  That would help managing regret."

     "The stock market is a marketplace where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. When a company wants to raise money, it can do so by issuing stocks, which are shares of ownership in the company. Investors can then buy these stocks, becoming part owners of the company. The price of a stock is determined by supply and demand in the market, with the price rising as more people want to buy the stock and falling as more people want to sell. The stock market can be a good way for companies to raise money and for investors to make money, but it also involves risk as the value of stocks can fluctuate widely.

It shows future promise from what i can tell as electric is being pushed for more and more.  Some of their tech is being used elsewhere and Ive also been seeing a lot of talk about a 20 to 1 split. That being said, the last split was 5 to 1, I think. And the stock bounced back and what, doubled? Its 1k a share right now and that is kind of daunting for me to think about, but the potential seems like it's there to for sure break even or make some extra. I chickened out at 86 bucks a share a while back and now look at me. 1000 the. Would be 10-11k now. Im just curious what everyones thoughts are? Concerns? It has a Buy rating last I checked. But again, I could be thinking about this allllllllll wrong and just be out a grand for nothing. Thanks and goodluck to everyone on your trades.\"",

I decided to make a free chrome extension where you can hover over a stock/crypto symbol like $TSLA or $BTC and view the candlestick chart directly without leaving Twitter.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSome other features I added are:\\n\\n\\\\- Ability to switch between different time frames (5 min, 1 day, 1 week, and more) by pressing 'Q' or 'E'\\n\\n\\\\- Ability to save tickers to watch list and view all your saved symbols at once by pressing 'W' when hovering over the chart. You can also copy the saved symbols and input it directly to your broker's watchlist.\\n\\n\\\\- Ability to add indicators and different time frames to customize the chart to your liking\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you guys want to try out the extension, here's the link:\\n\\n[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stock-hover/bnmmdnmoejecmdjbidpefhlbophdkkkl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stock-hover/bnmmdnmoejecm\"",

A few months before that people were afraid they were going to have to file bankruptcy, but with that offering they rescued themselves and gleaned the cash they needed to keep going. Now, after a 5:1 split and another MASSIVE run to pre-split prices of almost $2.5k, ol musky boy files a $5 billion shelf which basically means they can now sell up to 5 billion in shares whenever they want.

The flow of stock market money away from tech stocks into other industries and away from those currently overvalued/priced tech companies.\n\nIf you wanna buy low and sell high, well it's the time to sell after a long bull run on tech and buy what is currently cheap as a result of the pandemic.

     "I deliberately avoided editorializing the title, but I find too many value investors are throwing their hands up and avoiding any serious scrutiny into the current valuation of TSLA, and particularly how it's defied basically any value-oriented analysis over the last decade. Prof. Damodaran shows his usual honesty and rigor by taking on both topics on this lightning rod of a stock. Besides being the world's 5th largest publicly-traded company, TSLA is literally half of the automobile sector at over $1T valuation. No one is obligated to take a position on it of course, but dismissing its entire run as irrational and acting like there are no lessons to be learned is cowardly, IMO.\n\nProf. Damodaran, for his part values it at $571, making it overvalued to be sure. But that also implies that TSLA was not so absurdly expensive as recently as 3 months ago. I think a key observation on his part is that TSLA hasn't actually exceed his 2013 estimates of 2021 revenue and margin. But notably, rather than easing into mature growth rates and margin expansion, TSLA seems to be accelerating over the last two years. A 2013 DCF with 2021 as its terminal year would've almost certainly underestimated TSLA because it would've assumed their growth would be slowing down rather than speeding up."

Well, it is nice to catch a wave, a wave of good will, being the only one outthere building electric cars (not true, Toyota had them since the 80's), a wave of private investors ditching out money on reddit feeds and robinhood push to help you rise despite poor performance. But duh, if you are Elon Musk it does not matter if you don't know everything about the car you are presenting, it doesn't matter if an UNBREAKABLE window breaks during presentation, your shares will rise. \\n\\nBut now, people have the tools to DD and they notice a PE of 1260, an EPS of 0.62 generated on government subsidies, no profit from selling cars, recall of more than 130.000 cars, a quarter of TESLA's entire\"",

Instead they built off-site and then had to ship, place, and tie in all of these parts. It'll instead be lower quality (more leaks, worse foundations) and likely higher cost total than doing normal construction.\n\nIf anything this confirms my view on investing in China, which is to not ever.

     "I think of this like a more volatile version of what Apple has seen the last few weeks. Leading up to the 5G event, Apple options were in high demand. This caused people to demand shares to write calls and puts. This excess demand was duplicated by speculators buying shares before the event. This created a bubble that popped when nothing unexpected came from the event. The people who bought shares for covered options don\u2019t actually want to hold them and dumped them back on the market and other shareholders that buy rumor and sell news dumped too. That\u2019s why Apple stock dumped all last week, lots of people dumping their shares after the event. Tesla has similar overwhelming demand for options that causes share price to bubble and after event prices to fall. I don\u2019t know if they will follow the Apple model and take weeks to shrug off the post event share dump or whether Tesla will bounce this week. It\u2019s hard to tell and Tesla investors tend to be aggressively buying dips, so maybe Tesla is okay this week."

     "Tesla is as close to a Ponzi scheme as any public company on Earth.   It is relatively financially stable due to its status as a Meme stock so was able to raise capital at very low to no cost which coupled with selling their environmental credits has allowed them to make it to the status of a small unprofitable car manufacturer.   Their autonomous driving technology is second tier.  Their solar panel company loses money.  They have convinced their marks that they have battery technology when it is their suppliers that own that technology.   They are in fact an unprofitable (except for the credits they sell which will go away in the wash of new EVs being offered by the real auto manufacturers) small auto company.\n\nI do like their products but I would much prefer to own a Cadillac Lyriq or Mercedes EQS when I come up for a new car in a year or two.  However even with the EQS having a range of 478 miles I wouldn't buy one due to range limitations.  Maybe in 10 years when recharging is quicker and as accessible as petrol stations today I would then actually own one."

     "Generally speaking when a buyout or take private transaction is announced there is a difference between the current price and the offer price. In this case the offer is 420 and the current stock price was 344. After the deal is public the gap between the share price and offer price usually closes (eg the stock goes up) but not all the way to the offer price since it must reflect risks and uncertainties that the offer will actually be completed. The difference between the two is the markets assessment of he likelihood of the deal going through. The thing is it can take some time for equilibrium to be found and the stock price to adequately quantify these risks. So the stock will usually be volatile until then.\n\nI would find it extremely unlikely Musk would actually take the company private as you would need some type of financing for this plus the debt already on the balance sheet. (10 billion) So you would need to either get someone to write a check for 75 billion, or do an LBO for some portion of the 75B which then gets added to companies balance sheet and would add to it\u2019s already prodigious cash burn.\n\nI think Musk is just trying to fuck with the shorts and this is an easy way to do so.\n"

     "Tesla is a terrible business to LBO. LBO's require a ton of leverage and then the strategy is to take the existing cash flow to service the interest and cost cut the business back into profitability and then sell or relist. Tesla has no where near the cash flow needed to service the high yield debt that would be needed to take it private (rough math 8% debt to buy out 71bn worth of stock at $420 would have a interest service charge of $5.7bn per year... Telsa is forecasted to cash flow \\~2-3bn next year), so you are going bankrupt before any capital expansion. And that's the bigger point. Tesla needs to raise a ton of capital to fund its future growth. Public markets are really good at doing this! Going back to VC capital with a big $420/share valuation is ass backward because the VC has to think of their own exit strategy and in 5-10 years Tesla will definitely be comped against its auto peers as it will be in full blown production / harvest. peers are value far lower. So super risky for a VC or PE vs a small start up that can still play with pie in the sky valuation thinking. Net net this was click bate. Sell."

Once a buyout/merger/acquisition is announced, the current market price will jump to around the buyout/merger/acquisition share price. If the company does not offer a premium, there is little incentive for current shareholders with voting rights to vote for going private and selling their shares.\n\nA market share price (after announcement) above the buyout/merger/acquisition share price typically indicates that the market thinks the offer may be raised (ex. a higher competing bid for an acquisition) while a market share price (after announcement)  below the buyout/merger/acquisition share price typically indicates the market thinks there is decent risk that the deal falls through.\n\nFor your original question, the share price jumped because the market expected a >7% premium if a buyout were to occur. On a side note, I believe Elon would prefer to make Tesla private again though I doubt he has the capital and revenues needed to make this happen."

     "The most ridiculous up day in the markets and these fools still don\u2019t understand what\u2019s coming. An up day in a semi-weakened unemployment report and downward manufacturing reports. Wait for the CPI report and the suckers will raise us to 4100 and 11,4 on the NAsdaq.  Yet the future is not the lowering of inflation. It is the lowering of manufacturing, profits, and interest rates, which didn\u2019t fall because of a Fed Pivot but because they say a recession is coming!  A world wide recession. QT is taking money away which means less money to use. If the interest rates drop further I would be scared out of my mind about the recession but there are too many retail investors and money making fools just trying to grind out daily profits from suckers who don\u2019t realize the truths. I think the fed will go another .5 in Feb and may do a last 25 and then stop or may stop after this 50. Either way only two things will happen. Inflation falls and the Fed halts for awhile, or because of the strong economy, need for labor, still too many people with money ( which I have nothing personally against ) inflation resumes which requires 6-8  % in hikes.  \n     This is a different market and time and people. The Fed has never ever had to raise rates from a zero rate. The Fed was always fortunate to raise from 3-4 % starting points to raise rates to 7-8 percent to halt inflations. We were at 2% rates for two longs when the fed raised to 3.5 to scare everyone and had to back down. We started at ZERO percents. For nearly 2 years. You think that 4-5% may scare people? Well, like I said these are different times and different investors. Guess we will find out."

     "My opinion is hard disagree.  I haven't seen truly bearish sentiment at all.  People who have been investing for a few years can't recognize bearishness, they seem to think anything slightly negative but true is a \"bearish talking point\" or \"doomsday conspiracy theories.\"  People cherry pick parts of earnings calls and Jerome speeches and ignore anything slightly negative.  People are complaining out one side of their mouth about not being able to afford life despite having a good job then out the other side screech at anyone who hints a recession is coming is a conspiracy theorist.\n\nI have a watch list of close to 200 stocks and none are undervalued right now.  That is almost unprecedented. During \"normal\" times, a random amount, maybe 10-20% will be in a dip for either no reason or for a made up reason (such as articles that Amazon will enter so and so industry). That's how I made money.  I would think, is there a reason this good company is cheap, not find one, buy it, and it would go up in 6 months.  Now, every darn this is overpriced. Boomer dividend low growth stocks. Tech stocks. Old falling apart used cars in the middle of nowhere.  Dumpy houses in the middle of nowhere in need of expensive repairs.  The economic situation is actually worse in 2008 in the sense that then, broke people bought houses they had no business buying. Now 6-figure earners are struggling to afford basics.\n\nI'm also seeing loads of \"Q4 earnings was bad but we're raising or keeping high guidance\" comments in earnings calls which has me scratching my head.  Do people actually believe all of this? And I'm also never lived through so much skewing of earnings calls.  Like, the market and investors used to just take lower earnings and bad guidance at face value. I also really wish people grasped the \"just because someone beat expectations doesn't mean earnings are up\" concept.\n\nBear markets end when people who buy \"real\" companies (not bankrupt companies, not 20 year old tech companies with PEs of 200) get scared and stop buying the freaking dip for two seconds.  I'm watching all of these stocks and the market won't let them drop more than a few percent points. This used to only happen in roaring bull markets."

A alternating series of kicking it down the road, masking of indications, and mini bubble ruptures.\n\nHowever, dollar milkshake theory and the everything bubble exists. As traders, we shouldn\u2019t be bullish or bearish. Government intervention is not only the reason for the crash but also the reason it doesn\u2019t crash. \n\nEverybody has reason to be bullish or bearish. The market \u201cpriced everything in\u201d is not real. Every bubble is bound to pop eventually so it should go down right? Since it\u2019s forward looking\u2026..Newsflash, it\u2019s forward looking to \u201ca degree\u201d. If JPOW says anything other than 25 bps, the market will react, which isn\u2019t pricing in shit. \n\nEven with 25 bps, the market will probably dip. Just because of the mechanics of strengthening the dollar and the algos selling in reaction. \n\nIf JPOW is dovish, go bullish, if he hawkish, go bearish. Mainly because the economic phenomenon is difficult for anyone to wrap their heads around completely (I\u2019m studying all the time and keep getting conflicting signals). \n\nIt is very likely JPOW will screw this up by either being too hawkish or dovish and will overshoot. Just don\u2019t fight  \u201cTHE MARKETS PERCEPTION OF FED\u201d. JPOW very commonly \u201cspooks\u201d the market, and the market moves in tandem with JPOW, only for them to, at some random point of good news, start fighting the fed and moving in the opposite directions."

While I think options are completely wrong to deal with at this point in time for you as well as with this amount of capital, I do strongly suggest to learn a bit more about valuation trying to find good value plays that can maybe-probably-not-but-just-maybe beat the market significantly. If you take the time to learn, you can feel safer diversifying into more risky assets a portion of your portfolio. Even 20$ (20% risk) invested in a decent company that is now somewhat distressed but can get out of it, and which is currently trading at few dollars can create wonders to your overall return."

     "> I see this as a great buying opportunity, as demand for tesla cars appear higher than ever.  \n\nI think this is a bit misguided as one of the primary concerns with the company for the immediate future is demand.\n\nDemand in the US appears to have plateaued. It was sort of hinted at during earnings but excuses were made for why. Not wanting to touch on US Model Y deposit figures was also a MAJOR red flag as they were happy to boast about the 400k+ deposits for the Model 3. \n\nThat being said, demand is still high across the world. But, again, they simply don't have the network/infrastructure in place to start focusing on this at this time. They tried to dip their toes into international distribution this past quarter and clearly it won't be sustainable with the current setup. \n\nOnce the Shanghai factory ramps up things will operate much more smooth and demand will be easier to supply. But it still doesn't answer the demand that's coming from other meccas which will require an increase in manufacturing from somewhere...\n\nAs big of a fan of what they're doing and their overall goal, i'd be a bit weary of going all in on Tesla right now. Outlook over the next year doesn't look so great. Maybe re-examine again early next year."

     "Like others have said, Tesla is dependent on whether or not you think Elon can pull through. I ultimately respect the man for what he's done and what he's trying to do. His over enthusiasm has landed him in hot water with over promises and some missed deadlines, but he believes in his work and strives for consumers happiness rather than the numbers. \n\nIt's a double edge sword, the numbers all show Tesla has been growing and has been successfully expanding in the long run. The thing is he's growing it at his pace and not the investors. Long term, I don't see the company going anywhere. Even in an economic collapse; they never started an automotive revolution, but they did popularize it. Same could be said with robotaxi and the works. They don't need to be first, I'd rather them be the apple of the car industry, perfecting what others may put out.\n\nHere's my bottom line, there was a point in time where Elon had to choose between two companies: SpaceX or Tesla, if he want one to succeed it basically meant pulling the plug on the other and letting it die. He didn't. He chose both, for better or worse. It could've all blown up in his face and left him \"penniless\", but thankfully for him it worked out. I call that dedication. If the man is so dedicated and has so much faith in his work, then I can overlook all the controversy surrounding him. Missed deadlines do not mean it will never come. Just my two cents. Of course do your own DD."

Another way to say it that inventory periods are falling.\n\n[https://www.grufity.com/stock/TSLA-Tesla/Ratio-Metrics](https://www.grufity.com/stock/TSLA-Tesla/Ratio-Metrics)\n\nAssets to Sales ratio is falling.

The problem is that there are always losers, and inclusion date losers are likely gonna lose more than normal. Also, if any company is gonna deviate from the pattern, I'd imagine it's one far from ordinary like TSLA.\n\nHype =/= a good entry point for your position.  It's just hype."

The $670-695 spike was index fund buy in end of day trades so that increase will remain because they will hold their shares from now on.  If you see a fairly large drop off buy that dip, but avoid buying near $700 inclusion price in the very near future.

In reality, Tesla has lost 30% EV market share in Europe last years and they also lost 11% in the U.S from ONE other vehicle! On top of that they have only been profitable for one full year...Its ok to loose market share in an expanding market but there's also A LOT of competition coming out in the next 5 years! Good luck!"

This is a great video i\\'ve found that puts all these potential innovations into a digestible 30min format. Jordan from The Limiting Factor discusses some of his ideas as to how TSLA plans to scale the production of higher energy density batteries, with longer range/ life. Furthermore, he describes what options he believes TSLA has to scale the production of these batteries into the terrawhat hr per year. Lastly, I\\'ve seen many TSLA bulls fail to adequately describe the potential impact of BID beyond \"their gonna show off their great battery technology\" when TSLA bears ask what advantages they actually have. Hopefully this video from Jordan can show investors what TSLA is up too, along with the evidence to support his claims. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nvideo: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTFyxbm3Ew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYTFyxbm3Ew) \\n\\n(Skip to 27:00 if you wanna hear re'",

No, they're constantly beating down and rejecting federal go green initiatives all over the board. He's making an enemy of the very people who will provide the most for his number one business. Twitter isn't going to make him the richest man in the world that for sure. In fact, it will likely do the opposite even if you exclude the amount of financial resources as he continues to be even more bold with the things he says. \n\nExample: this idiot literally told everyone to vote for republicans in house because we have a dem president.
