  "Text": "b'On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giants first major new product category since 2015s Apple Watch.\\n\\nThe new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the companys Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.\\n\\nApples virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.\\n\\nThe device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Me'",

Big surprise for me. \n\nMac sales had a massive decline. This is what people were expecting considering previous earnings of the other tech companies we saw from computer sales. \n\niPad also declined but not as bad as I was expecting.\n\nWearables and accessories was flat which still shows there is resilience even in this slowing economy. \n\nServices increased again. This was to be expected and helped soften the blow from the declines in other divisions like Mac and iPad. \n\nDeclines of sales in the Americas, China, and Japan. However increases in both Europe and the Rest of Asia Pacific.\n\nThey also announced a 4% increase in their dividend as well as a massive 90 billion dollar stock buyback. \n\nOverall I am completely fine with the quarter especially giving the low expectations people had which you can see in the expectation\u2019s Wall-Street had.

Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance. With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.\\n\\nYet I'm slowly moving my portfolio to have more and more these stocks. I'm curious what percentages of your portfolio are allocated in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT? \\nIgnore the portions in your ETFs.\\n(I understand index fund is the way but may be that's not for me)\"",

     "Buying the biggest companies in the world has historically not been a winning strategy over the long term, no matter how impenetrable their moats are at the moment. (I'm sure someone will share that graphic of the top market cap companies over time) The amount of runway for $1T, $2T companies just doesn't compare to what is possible with $500M, $10B market cap companies. I don't want to just buy the past winners, but buy the future ones. This is why the core strategy of my portfolio are large tilts to small cap (value) stocks, which is both riskier but also has higher rewards in the long run. They are also a hedge when big tech hits a wall, like happened post-Dot Com. [Take a look at 2000-1](https://i.imgur.com/xIpUKyL.png) in this table of small cap value versus the broader market in down years.\n\nI like buying big tech 'tactically', as they do have rock solid balance sheets and moats, so when they do dip (irrationally), I buy them. This rewarded me greatly in 2022, as I doubled down on \n\n- GOOG (+25%, 2% of port.)\n- META (+60%, 2.6% of port.)\n- MSFT (+17%, 2.8% of port.)\n- AAPL (+19%, 1.9% of port.)\n- SMH (+24%, 1.4% of port)\n- AMD (+12%, 2.5% of port.)\n\nYes I didn't time the bottom perfectly or I'd be much richer. I had opened up positions on these in 2021-2, and either averaged down from expensive levels or bought when I felt was too cheap. AMD/MSFT were among my worst timed purchases. But these are not necessarily long term holds since I already have exposure through index funds and I think they are fairly to over-valued now."

The Wall Street firm reported first-quarter results on Tuesday, a day after Apple launched its new savings accounts with an annual percentage yield over 4%. The new accounts carry Apples brand and are administered through the iPhone, but Goldman Sachs is the companys financial partner. Weve obviously worked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who has a Marcus deposit and that overlap is small, Solomon said on his companys earnings call. But well obviously watch closely to see whether or not theres any cannibalization. Solomon added that the Apple offering is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and said its always good for us to broaden our depo'",

     "So, like, some people on here are totally not thinking straight when it comes to AAPL and thinking everything will just keep going up and up.\n\n>Well, as we look for companies to invest in, we always keep an eye out for those that possess what we call a \"moat\" - that is, a competitive advantage that helps them maintain their profitability and market position over time. And one sign of a truly great company is that it has the ability to fund its own growth and operations without needing to rely on outside sources of capital.\n\n>So, if you're asking me what I think makes a truly wonderful company, I would say that it's one that has built up such a strong position in its industry that it doesn't need to turn to the capital markets for funding, whether it's for growth or simply to stay afloat. That kind of financial strength is a sign of a business that is truly built to last.\n\n---- Warren Buffett in ASM, 2000\n\nSure, borrowing money can be cheaper than selling off part of the company, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. When a company borrows money, they gotta pay it back with extra interest. That eats into their profits and makes it harder to reach their goals.\n\nAAPL has been growing super fast and has an edge over the competition, but let's be real, no company can just keep growing forever without facing some problems. Taking on debt is always a bit risky, 'cause it can mess with future cash flow and make it harder to pay back the debt during a downturn, which could hurt the company's value. And if something bad happens to the whole industry or just AAPL, it could be way worse than anyone expects."

If a smart watch gets broken or lost, you have a bad day, but you get over it and can go without ever replacing it. If a smart phone gets broken or lost, you pretty much lose a huge portion of what you can do in life until it gets replaced.\n\nThe Vision is going to resemble much more of the watch's importance than the phone's. It will probably have a place in people's lives as a side grade to a PC or home entertainment system.\n\nThat being said, Apple stock is going to continue to go up.

Plus iphones were produced in China and costed a heavy import duty. \n\nFew years ago apple started manufacturing in India and got to save on the import duty, this allowed them to be competitive at pricing, especially during sales. Plus average price of Android smartphones started going up. Fall of OnePlus and premium image of apple has allowed it to become most popular expensive phone and do record sales here. Hence apple has started taking india seriously due to the growth potential."

These products are not for the average person.  Vision Pro is not for you, or the average broke person. There are professional audio and video people who spend $20K+ on their setups. That ain't changing. Apple Products range from the every day to the professional. Guess what? The broke college student still buys the $899 MacBook Air.

     "Dear esteemed readers, allow me to elucidate upon the situation at hand with regard to Apple's recent VR headset launch and its impact on the company's stock prices. Despite the highly anticipated nature of this event, it would appear that the actual product failed to meet the lofty expectations of investors and analysts alike. The KeyBanc analyst in question, Mr. Nispel, has astutely observed that the hype surrounding the launch was indeed well overdone, resulting in a sell-the-news event that caused a decline in Apple's stock prices. \n\nIt would seem that the Vision Pro headset is a case of style over substance, as it is both costlier than anticipated and lacking in the advanced features that were promised by Apple. This has led to a significant disconnect between the perceived value of the product and its actual utility, which has understandably caused investors to lose confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its promises. \n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon Apple to address these concerns and provide a more compelling value proposition for its VR headset if it wishes to regain the trust of its investors and customers. In doing so, the company must also be mindful of the increasing competition in the VR market, as well as the rapidly evolving technological landscape that is constantly reshaping consumer expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, while Apple's recent VR headset launch was undoubtedly a significant event, it would appear that the actual product failed to live up to the hype surrounding it. This has led to a decline in the company's stock prices, which serves as a cautionary tale for future product launches and highlights the importance of delivering on promises and meeting customer expectations."

Its nice that Apple products work really well together. One particular favorite of mine is how they have improved upon bluetooth which can otherwise be a rather finicky standard. Airplay, Airdrop, etc. seem to work closer to expectation. iPhone to iPhone functionality like iMessage is an absolute *dream*.\n\nEven though *Im sure it is bleeding like a siv anyway*, I appreciate Apple\u2019s stance on customer privacy.\n\nAlso very subjective but in my experience they tend to last longer and stay healthier in general.\n\nI can understand that if I had different use-cases, I would want an Android, but these are just some of my reasons.

Doesn't mean that iPhone doesn't have any flaws, there are things that drive me crazy, but it just works. Back in 2020 when I switched from Samsung, they were shipping in Europe with inferior CPU, battery life and resale value that degrades faster than a teenager getting drunk for the same price as iPhone. Not to mention the device life of Android has 2-3 years of software updates, where Apple keeps 6.  So it was a no brainer for me.\n\nMight give Android a try again someday, but I am comfortable with the iPhone that can last me at least another 2 years."

Remember, who is going to buy this garbage? 100s of millions did  The AR/VR set look weird because its unusual, and by no means I think its the future, or near-term future, but it will be something used by a group of users, especially creative userbase. \n\nApple selling 1M or 5M units from this set in the first 2 years ain't moving the needle. Apple making 1B to 3.5B in Net Income from this ain't changing the valuation, and I can't stress on how stupid it is to assume this product is changing the structure or profitability of Apple. \n\nApple is setting the industry standard right now, and the sky is the limit for developers. That being said, literally this is as catalyst as apple released a new season of Ted Lasso. It is pointless. If this product generates 1B in NI a Q for Apple, that is NOTHING. \n\nIf you buy Apple, its for the ecosystem, brand loyalty, and earning power; not AR set. Apple will keep selling shit load of Phones, Tables, Macs, and Accessories, and nothing changing that."

Think about how much money they can pull from that pool and if they continue to grow their ecosystem that opportunity will only increase.

     "As many others will point out, do your own research and make your own evaluations.  That being said, to your question, I'm not hopping on board the AAPL train anytime soon.\n\nCouple of reasons - their debt/equity ratios are high, on the levels one would expect to see for companies like F and other auto manufacturers.  Whereas said manufacturers have a high degree of assets (resulting in reasonable P/B ratios), AAPL is crazy-high at nearly 40:1.  By contrast, a lot of other high-growth startups are in the 5-15 range, if memory serves right.\n\nIf share equity gets wiped out, the debt/equity ratio is going to end up very high, which to me says they're generating a lot of their growth and financing operations via debt.  If that's the case, then with current conditions and high interest rates, those debts could start to drag down operations some time in the future.  In short, it feels too much like a house of cards to me, where it's being invested to as the world's savings account, rather than warranting the price it has by its own merits.\n\nThere are lots of arguments to buy it - solid brand loyalty, high brand recognition, regular wear and tear plus new features driving people to buy new phones, having them expand into other markets like wearables, entertainment, etc...  But I don't think that I'd buy it anytime soon.  If I was holding onto any stock from the early days, I'd personally sell while the going is good."

Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\\n\\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\\n\\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\\n\\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company.

Eventually it will get to a point where even if they make new products that are highly profitable, because they are so big already that may translate into single digit growth.  They would need monster success from new capital deployed just to keep up a modest growth rate.\n\nIt does look like Apple still has a lot of growth potential though.  They are far from 100% of the phone/pc/device market, and there are still ways they can capture more revenue from its users from the app store, fintech, streaming media, and so on.  Eventually it will start reaching a limit, but I don't see that limit yet.  The bigger risk around Apple is its dependency on Asia for production and sales, and how China may upset all that."

     "MSFT - I think they have an incredible MOAT. In my opinion,  their offerings are the most iron clad relative to economic conditions. Their investment in OpenAI only makes me that much more excited about future possibilities.\n\nHaving said that? These are all amazing companies. I just feel MSFT is more focused than both GOOGL and AMZN while thinking that their basket of products/services is more diverse than AAPLs in respect to both b2b and b2c value."

     "Out of those three I would say Microsoft. Best diversification, best moat, and has segments that are crucial to government operations meaning it\u2019s backed by the government to the extent of they won\u2019t let Microsoft fail. Apple is very dependent on hardware sales since that is how they get users into their ecosystem. And as for their hardware comparable alternatives are available creating some risk there. All it takes is a few missteps on the hardware side for Apple to crack. Amazon e-commerce is low margin but they do have AWS which is high margin.  Overall amazons success weighs heavy on AWS. Amazon does have data on users like shopping habits and previous purchases to help drive ad sales. Microsoft products are heavily integrated into most people lives to the point where there is no real comparable alternative and these offerings are through so many different segments. This is why I would say Microsoft is the strongest of the three. As for the mega cap with the biggest upside I would say alphabet as of right now. They have multiple growth segments like cloud, AI, driverless tech, healthcare, search, YouTube, and so much more. On top of it they are trading at the lowest valuation of all the mega caps right now. But to the original question Microsoft for sure in my opinion."

     "This is a tough choice. MSFT is the best value of the 3 currently and has a nice dividend for the tech space. And all three choices aren\u2019t going away IMO.\n\nHowever, if I had to pick one, I\u2019d go with AMZN. You\u2019ve got Walmart, CVS and Alphabet rolled into one conglomerate with AMZN. The logistics tentacles that the company has cast a wide moat alone, not to mention its other diversified operations.\n\nThe only thing I don\u2019t love about AMZN is the P/E ratio currently. I get that this is due to R&D investments by the company, yada yada yada, but a P/E ratio of 90 is insane!"

     "First, those 3 companies are great and I have been tracking them to invest when their valuations are better.  \n\nBasically, I am waiting until their P/Es are favorable which means MSFT needs to be at $200 and AAPL needs to be between $100 - $110.  Earnings will be a big decider of that and since MSFT has announced a layoff, I'm pretty sure their quarter announcement will be bad since I've never heard of a company announcing positive earnings and a layoff at the same time.  I'm avoiding Amazon until Jassey can finish cutting all the costs that Besos implemented. AMZN needs to go to at least $60 for the valuation to make sense.\n\nAll of these numbers might take forever and I'm willing to wait.\n\nThe one that is the closest on a valuation level, for me, is actually GOOGL at a 19/20 PE.  Fair value is only about $10 lower than it's at right now, and again, another great company.  I think I'll be investing in GOOGL before the others solely based on valuation and how fast the stocks get to fair value."

Advertising is one of their most recent venture in 2019, not much information was given on it but seems like cash for basically no additional costs. \n\nWord of caution for AMZN though, AMZN has been in negative free cash flows for the past 2 years. Reason given by management is because they\u2019ve doubled their network focusing more on growth, profits later. If you like their mantra you could consider digging more into AMZN\n\nAs for GOOG, 80% of their revenue comes from advertising. Advertising is a cyclical business. Meaning when the economy tanks, GOOG goes down with it as well.\n\nThe good thing about GOOG is that it\u2019s a software company so the main bulk of cost should come from R&D there shouldn\u2019t be very high costs required to maintain the servers, so once products get through GOOG just has to wait on cash to flow in, their margins have been consistently 20+% for the past 5-6 years compared to AMZN\u2019s 2-5% iirc.\n\nThe most exciting thing for GOOG is that it\u2019s looking to break into different modal for search. If tech is more of your thing GOOG would probably be your best bet.\n\nI know you asked about AAPL, MSFT and AMZN but I haven\u2019t had a look at AAPL and MSFT so Iwouldn\u2019t want to feed you misinformation."

     "Consider this an assessment more of how these stock tickers will do, not how good the companies are, or their businesses are...\n\nAAPL is not down that much, nor is MSFT.\n\nBut AMZN stock certainly has been pummelled.  They've been recently hated as a company and a stock.  That typically is a setup for a strong bounce.\n\nWe've seen it over and over.  Facebook was getting daily coverage for their evils, their idiot owner tripled down on \"metaverse\" and then the stock cratered.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.  They didn't change or fix anything.  They just waited for the spotlight to move.\n\nTesla was ludicrously overvalued, and has a psychotic fascism cheerleader and Russian puppet owner.  Product quality tanked along with reputation, and there's strong competition everywhere.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.\n\nNvidia hit a chip glut and people realized a lot of their business was from selling wildly overpriced silicon for unsustainable crypo.  Yet it's had a 100% rebound on... nothing, really.\n\nNetflix was mismanaged and hid the fact they hit customer saturation years ago and price saturation too.  Their desperate response was to call customers thieves for doing password sharing NFLX had always encouraged, then an incompetent money-losing ad-tier launch which, at best, cannibalizes themselves for low value customers and negative revenue.  Shady execs now pledging to hide the subscriber numbers.  Stock is up 150%.\n\nSo while I don't have confidence in Amazon to fix their business problems (like how most of their site and experience is just displaying datafeed entries of third party offshore knockoff junk and counterfeit product inserted into their broken fulfillment structure) I would say that if it's anything like how the other floundering large \"tech\" companies have seen their stock price go parabolic without reason, they're in the best position for senseless rebound."

Source: AP\nTesla Model S\nThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla had \"actual severe defects\".\n\nBerlin, D\u00fcsseldorf The electric car manufacturer Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal ordered on Monday that Tesla must refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The reason is \"serious defects in driving comfort and safety\", including unwanted braking.\n\nAs far as is known, there is no higher court judgment against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The decision of June 12 has 14 pages and reads like a reckoning with the statements that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making about the quality of his driver assistance systems for years, often under the term \"Autopilot\"."

     "I think tesla is in trouble. They got so big in their early years because the tech in their cars was better than other brands, their electric range was higher than anyone else, and they were the only brand capable of mass producing electric cars to meet demand. This was the reason so many people were overlooking the very clear quality control issues that they have. The most important thing they had to do was solve their QC issues before other brands caught up. However, other brands caught up and tesla still faces terrible QC concerns. This may affect them a lot in the future. \n\nNow, other brands have similar or better technology and driving assistance. Everybody has a big screen, a trend that Tesla started.\n\nOther brands have developed better autonomous systems than Tesla. Mercedes, GM, and Ford are the top now.\n\nOther brands have electric cars that equal or beat Tesla's range and charging speeds.\n\nOther brands are able to produce and develop electric cars at a good rate. It can be argued that brands are still catching up in this sense, but they are most definitely catching up at rapid speed.\n\nThe last current saviour for Tesla is their far superior charging network. This was something that was planned to take ***years*** for other brands to catch up to. However, they are catching up fast. Furthermore, other brands are now gaining access to tesla charging network. This is another nail in the coffin for tesla.\n\nTesla is running out of time to solve their issues. They need to address the issues in their cars before the other brands leave them in the dust. When the other brands have better electric cars that are readily available and affordable, along with good charging networks, tesla will struggle to sell units."

The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.

In the vast majority of cases, pouring years of manual labor and $gigazillions of compute resources into AI will not result in something profitable.\n\nGenerative AI in e.g. Photoshop is amazing but that market is a tiny smidgen. There's no new breakthrough for self driving cars or anything else. You can point at everything ChatGPT can do but it's already done, it's unbelievably expensive, and what's stopping it from becoming exponentially better isn't computing power, it's training data and labor. What's sustaining it is how widespread its usefulness is and how disruptive it is to competitors.\n\nPalantir dude is right. And Altman, Woz and Musk alike know the government isn't capable of stopping AI just like they're not capable of stopping drugs or FOSS.

There's nothing about LLMs that suggest there's going to be any sign of sentience. GPT and other LLMs are much closer to just a traditional search engine that's wrapped up in a fancy NLP-output package than it is to anything \"live and organic and thinking\". It has no clue what you're talking about, it simply rephrases your question into a searchable prompt, then literally searches the internet for the answer, finds the relevant parts in the articles, then stitch them together using state of the art NLP (probably transformers).\n\nAI also incapable of replacing any part of the industry that is on the cutting-cutting edge of human knowledge, since there's simply no data there. But the stuff closer to the center of human knowledge, absolutely. We should all be THANKFUL that AI will replace certain \"skilled labor positions\" like general surgeon, radiologists, etc. When you're looking for someone to perform a \"regular\" surgery (say dental crown, circumcision, colonoscopy, etc), do you want someone that has performed hundreds of the same surgeries? Because that's what AI is. In fact, LASIK for the longest time has entirely been machine-driven surgery, and it's one of the most successful surgeries out there. If you want a radiology report analyzed, don't you want a machine that has the most up to date knowledge of what cancer looks like, a system that can scan each image and WILL NOT miss a single pixel of data? Yeah absolutely.\n\nBut if you're looking for something that's at the absolute edge of humanity, say a neural chip implant, I'd rather have humans over a \"untrained\" AI.\n\nIf I'm McDonalds, AI is very welcome. The big mac is coming out the same every time. If I'm a 3* michelin star restaurant, AI simply has no place."

They can easily negotiate a new contract with Microsoft. This will absolutely destroy Googles business. The only way for Google to maintain its position as the default browser would be to pay more than Microsoft or invest heavily into the technology. Either way, their margins get hit. \\nMicrosoft has nothing to lose but some of its massive cash position. But the obstacle stopping mass adoption of Bing would be Apples position as Judge, Jury and Executioner. \\n\\nMy thoughts going forward? Apple is the king, and this further proves it.

     "These chatbots are a gimmick right now. Useful for certain things, but mostly a toy. As people become aware of their limitations, and how inaccurate they can be, the novelty will wear off. I think we are far away from this technology having a meaningful impact on these businesses.\n\nAnd although this might be naive of me, I have a very hard time believing a company like Alphabet wasn't fully aware of this as a potential threat to their business model. They've been working on AI themselves for years. Do you think nobody in the company thought, \"Hey guys, if AI gets integrated into search, that could hurt our search business.\"\n\nMy take on this whole thing? Alphabet hasn't been in any rush with AI because they know how complicated it is and they want to do it right. When they saw the release of ChatGPT and then Microsoft do their thing, they mistakenly rushed something out to show they're working on it too. It was more of a PR blunder than anything else. What they should have done was taken the high road by explaining the flaws in other companies' products, why it is such a complicated technology, and reassure their investors that what they eventually reveal will blow their minds."

     "\"Apple can just create their own search engine\" which they could do... if they could.  It's just like how Apple Maps is just nowhere near as good as Google Maps or even Bing Maps.  Apple was forced to bend over and allow Google Maps back on their devices.\n\nWith Search AI these search engines are going to get so complicated that Apple won't be able to just replicate it, they'll be forced to sign on.  There's really only two underlying search engines in the world.  Google makes one, Bing makes one.  Every other engine is based on either one.  Google represents a little over 90% of all searches.  So they're not going to get beat by better technology at this point.  In order for Chrome to become the most popular browser it required the US government to force Microsoft to give them their data and to not compete.\n\nI think BardAI's presentation not going well is going to mean Google isn't going to be able to \"defend\" against this.  The fact that BardAI in their presentation just gave false information is pretty bad.  I think people will be pretty excited to play with ChatGPT on Bing and I think it'll cause some people to permanently convert over to it.  I could see Bing being up to 20% of all searches in the next two years.\n\nI think the big thing with ChatGPT is that it's really really far ahead of the rest.  It's going to be incredibly useful in Microsoft Office (which is a major product for Microsoft).  \n\nI think Apple is honestly hooped.  They haven't really had a successful new product for a while and it'll be a few years of R&D before they'll be able come up with their next big seller."

The drop marks the largest-ever decline in a single quarter and contributed to a steep 11.3% decline for the year. 2022 ended with shipments of 1.21 billion units, which represents the lowest annual shipment total since 2013 due to significantly dampened consumer demand, inflation, and economic uncertainties.

The share of US ad revenues held by Facebooks parent Meta and Google owner Alphabet is projected to fall by 2.5 percentage points to 48.4 percent this year, the first time the two groups will not hold a majority share of the market since 2014, according to research group Insider Intelligence. This will mark the fifth consecutive annual decline for the duopoly, whose share of the market has fallen from a peak of 54.7 percent in 2017 and is forecast to decline to 43.9 percent by 2024. Worldwide, Meta and Alphabets share declined 1 percentage point to 49.5 percent this year.\\n\\nFour years ago, you wouldnt be talking about either [TikTok or Amazon] in advertising, said Dischler.

     "Probably not a lot of marketers chiming in here, I have over 20 years in the digital marketing space so I'll add some clarity. \n\n1.) Google will NEVER lose search market share, not in the traditional sense. The way you search today, if still applicable in 100 years, will belong to Google. The caveat, of course, is that people stop searching (googling) and start asking AI questions instead, BUT Google actually has the edge there as well with internal AI (not yet public)   \n\n\nSince search ads are the #1 driver of revenue you might be concerned that TikTok or Amazon or Apple are going to take away search market share, and that's just not going to happen...  \n\n\nUnless. Apple bundles an AI search solution on iOS that rivals or beats Google. Think the buzz that Siri had years ago, but actually helpful. That would MURDER Google's marketshare. \n\n...but, as we've seen (with Maps & Email) just bundling a solution doesn't mean users won't gravitate towards the better Google solution. \n\nWhich brings up one last point. Google owning Android gives them 50% automatic marketshare. So, it's really that last 50% of mobile (iOS) that they have to protect. \n\nAll that needs to be said about Google vs. anyone else is that Google has search, and as long as Google has search they have the absolute highest intent ad clicks on Earth. Why? People are searching for a solution and able to find it. \n\nFacebook doesn't allow this. \n\nApple allows this in an app setting (such as finding apps) but you can't just get an insurance quote or a loan. \n\nTikTok doesn't allow this. \n\nAmazon doesn't allow offsite traffic.\n\nDesktop search is going nowhere, either. Computer users will still use Google.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) TikTok. Here's the thing. It's a terrible advertising platform for us marketers. Creative (i.e. ad assets) are almost ephemeral in the sense the little twats using TikTok have about 3.5 second attention span. Ads go stale in days, not months. \n\nThis means advertisers will use it, but lose more often than win. It's kind of like 15+ years ago when Google rolled out the Google Display Network (GDN) which Adsense is based on. Everyone thought it was this massive new ad platform that will offset high search ad costs. Nope, it was just trash traffic for the most part. \n\nThat's TikTok. There's money to be made, but you're basically doing drive-by's on bored young adults that want to see someone with no bra jumping rope. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) Amazon. They are a very real threat to retail ad budgets. That's for sure. That's not going to stop people from advertising on Google or FB (especially for ad retargeting outside of the Amazon platform); but ad dollars and ad dollars, right? If you allocate more to Amazon because you sell on Amazon, it makes sense. \n\nWhich brings up another point. To use it you need to sell on Amazon! That cuts out a lot of Fortune 500 advertisers and doesn't really scoop up much high-CPC marketshare of industries like financial products, which make up the majority of Google's search ad revenue. \n\nUnfortunately, Amazon DOES have AWS (vs. Google Cloud) so if you're looking at this holistically as a business, Amazon has a LOT more going for them across multiple fronts. \n\n...but again, this shouldn't impact native search marketshare and Amazon does not drive traffic offsite, so that's a big no to 3rd party ads. \n\n4.) Then there's Apple. This company represents the #1 threat to Google's ad marketshare. As I stated earlier, simply bundling an AI search solution and selling ads would drastically cut into Google's search ad revenue IF Google didn't have a competing product. \n\nApple has something like 50% marketshare on mobile, so you can't discount what they have the ability to do with their device base (same with Google's Android) \n\nAs an advertiser do I care about Apple right now? Yes and no. \n\nNo because it only matters if you offer an app as a primary product, and a lot of the companies I work with don't (though, 1 does and we almost exclusively use Apple) and for obvious reasons, the Android version of apps aren't allowed to be advertised. \n\nApple's ad system is also pretty terrible. You can't drive traffic to a landing page offsite, everything goes straight to the download page. Great if you want app downloads, but also not that great if you want to tailor your message. \n\nI see a future where Apple certainly controls a lot of overall ad budgets since they have the mobile ecosystem (just like Google does) + higher quality users; but this shouldn't cut into Google's current revenue stream by much. \n\nThese are 2 very different products with VERY different intent as explained previously. Google traffic is super high intent and that's because people are looking for a solution across endless topics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.) Lastly, there's Facebook. As an advertiser I've given up on them. All is not well with FB. I would NOT purchase stock in their company unless I believe in their version of the Metaverse, because ads are no longer a consideration. \n\nThat says a lot. I've made millions advertising on Facebook. I would absolutely love nothing more than to continue advertising on FB for the rest of my life. There's no point. Apple killed them when they eliminated the ability to get attribution, and then FB killed themselves with Cambridge and FTC issues to the point they had to basically eliminate all of their great targeting options. \n\nFacebook has 3 massive problems. \n\n1.) It's too expensive. Costs on par with Google. \n\n2.) It has far lower quality and intent. People aren't searching, they're interrupted with an ad. \n\n3.) Attribution is basically gone. Who clicked what and who converted? Fuck if I know!\n\nFacebook in its current iteration stands absolutely no chance at taking Google's marketshare for anything but consumer lawsuits. IF the metaverse becomes of a thing and FB controls that, well, then, they're the biggest thing in the world, right? Can't refute that. \n\nBut, think about it. There's a reason Zuck pivoted so hard. He knows he lost the ad game and it's just a matter of time. Thanks to Apple, they can't fix their attribution problems so he has to create his own fucking world to monetize. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nIn closing. Will Google lose marketshare? Probably not. Maybe to Apple. Still probably not."

I think for headsets to make a significant about of money they'll have to be AR devices, not VR and I think were much farther away from that than people assume.\n\nOn the other hand... it's Apple so I have a hard time betting against them and will probably just sit on my shares."

Sales in the US are down nearly nine thousand units. HDFS, their financial services arm, set aside 51m in Q4 for losses which brought 2022 up to 145m in total.\n  \nFor a brand whose point of entry is over sixteen thousand and typically is in the high twenty thousand range these are continuing to be not good signs. Sales is not be helped by the fact they are continuing their supply chain surcharge which is a thousand or more on their most popular units.\n  \nhttps://investor.harley-davidson.com/news/news-details/2023/Harley-Davidson-Delivers-Strong-Fourth-Quarter-Financial-Results-Successfully-Completing-Second-Year-of-Hardwire-Strategic-Plan/default.aspx   \nhttps://s201.q4cdn.com/697889289/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/HOG-Q4-YE-2022-Earnings-Slides-2.02.23-FINAL.pdf    \n  \nI have no position in their stock, I am just a former owner of their motorcycles and likely a future customer should they choose to remove the surcharge. Dealers are going to be struggling this year and seeing sales decline in the US yet again while inventories are up will put pressure on the dealer network even more. \n  \nOh, on top of all that they will be importing a motorcycle (X350) designed and built in China with only their emblem added to the bike for their riding academy. Harley is no longer able to economically produce bikes they can use for their own riding academy"

     "While it's easy to be either unjustifiably pessimistic (\"bearish\") or irrationally exuberant (\"bullish\"), I've found that it's far more important for an investor to remain flexible with ones thesis in the face of uncertainty.\n\nWe've had a garbage year so far in the equity markets. From a probability perspective, the odds of us having a year like this one where we had 3+ red quarters in a row on a month-over-month basis in the S&P500 were 2 in 37 years. This year marks the 3rd time that we've had a period in the S&P where we have had 3 red quarters.\n\nDuring this 37 year time frame, we've seen relatively high interest rates in the 90s (8.25% peak  Fed rates, all the way down to 6%), and yet our markets have proven to be resilient. We also had 2 major drawdown events during this time; the dot-com era that resulted in a 44.82% peak month-to-month (MtM) drawdown, and the subprime crisis that resulted in a 50.97% drawdown. Prior to that, we did have a period in 1987 which had a 29.78% drawdown. This year, when we were down around 25%, I had called out that we have a low probability of additional downside being greater than 10-15%, for a total drawdown of 35-40%.\n\nAlthough some people are surprised by the moves up lately, I would argue that the market is still functioning within historical tolerances and probabilities. Whether or not we continue this ascent is anyone's guess. We have some headwinds coming near-term (inflation is still stubbornly high), but also some tailwinds which will help push stocks further (e.g. reducing corporate tax rates will be back on the agenda depending on the outcome of the mid-terms in 2 weeks).\n\nThe best thing that an individual investor can do is stick with their plan. If something isn't working with your investment thesis, change it.\n\nGood luck"

Non GAAP earnings (which I wouldn't use in most circumstances) is about 9.7. \n\nThose are pretty much the actual underlying earnings of the business aside from irregular costs/losses/investments, since things are wrapping up with juul the next quarters GAAP and non-GAAP puts it very close between 9 and 10 p/e.

According to the Wall Street Journal, the digital wallet would be operated by Early Warning Services, a joint venture from several banks that also runs Zelle.

The new wallet would initially be launched with Visa and Mastercard already on board, according to the report.\\n\\nThe move could be seen as an effort to slow Apples push into consumer banking, as the tech giant already offers a branded credit card and is exploring other products for their famously loyal customer base.

     "This is silly. Apple/Samsung/Google Pay are all built into the devices natively from the factory and the entire user experience with these wallets is curated around that; I.e., device security designed with these wallets in mind, and things like paying from your lock screen or watch without needing to unlock or even pull out your device, and integration to your computer and other devices. None of these are probably going to be a thing with a third-party wallet app, but even if they are, what motivation would any user have to switch from the current ecosystem that already works?\n\nJPMorgan tried a pointless payment app before (Chase Pay) and failed because again, there is absolutely no reason to use anything other than <your device> Pay, I don't see this being any different."

Throw in they are importing a designed in China and built in China X350RA model with Harley badges for their riding academy they may alienate many die hards"

Instead, the company will aim to produce 90 million handsets for the period, roughly the same level as the prior year and in line with Apple\u2019s original forecast this summer, the people said.  \nDemand for higher-priced iPhone 14 Pro models is stronger than for the entry-level versions, according to some of the people.

The short term treasury market is already going off the rails, as GS has suggested that X Day shall now arrive in June, rather than July or August.\n\nDon't buy this short term bear analysis?

Might go down more but might not. This company will be around in 20 years.\n\n \n\n$ ODFL, the country needs shipping and this company does it well.

Also getting a new ceo so price is rough. But dominating in the US. Record revenue even tho the headwinds are rough. Even in a recession the most addictive drug in the world will be there to ease your pain.\n\n\nand $CROX who doesn\u2019t love a funky shoe?

     "Ok so what stocks do you suggest should be discussed?\n\n1. We got mega cap tech companies like AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc even though are already established make a ton of money that is returned to shareholder value in the form of massive buybacks and dividends. So of course they are going to be discussed.\n\n2. We got speculative plays that blew up and are growing market share like AMD, TSLA, and NVDA. I would personally argue that the valuations make me not want to touch them. However I can see why these stocks would appeal to people as they are growing earnings like crazy and have the potential of being big blue chip companies.\n\n3. You got risky plays like META, and INTC. Me personally I am not touching them. However once again I can see why they would appeal to some people and be discussed as they are already established companies that make money but are trading at a low valuation due to big earnings loss and short term risk.\n\n4. We got just your standard blue chip dividend companies like JNJ, TGT, KO, PG, PEP, WM, etc. there is nothing really to discuss about these cause they are kind of universal buy and hold companies. They have been around for decades and have been growing stock price and dividends. So I don\u2019t know what is there to discuss except buy and hold. \n\n5. We got penny stocks and I feel like nobody discusses those cause of how much risk is involved in them. Most people on here lets be real have no idea what they are doing. So discussing penny stocks is not really a process and is just mindless speculation.\n\nSo my question to you is which stocks should be discussed? M**e stocks were basically banned from being discussed a long time ago."

It\u2019s a little premature now of course but that\u2019s where the huge growth will be imo. And mid level companies in China. \nThere will a lot more Tencent and baba coming around but it\u2019s really hard to research them.\n\nAnd the issue with robotics is that the big tech companies are all over this field. So it\u2019s hard to \u201cbet\u201d in nvidia in the robotic side if they keep appealing the crypto kids.\nAnd the etf/funds just pile up the same big players that do other stuff that rely on subscription growth or ad revenue. \n\nSo I\u2019m still trying to look for good stocks in robotics and mid level Chinese companies. \nBut seeing these huge ups and downs makes me just hold on for a bit."

Meanwhile Apple AAPL, -0.67%, as its own glitzy ad campaigns constantly remind us, is the one tech company that doesnt spray your data across the web. And, of course, theres Apples recent privacy changes to its operating system that wiped out an estimated $10 billion of revenue for Meta META, -0.54%.

It seems major tech companies (FB, Microsoft, Apple, Google) are making a comeback but 'miscellaneous' tech companies are losing value. For instance, I shorted $PINS last week and made 20%.

Coinbase already has the highest fees of any exchange that their customers don't necessarily appreciate.

According to a study published Tuesday by Appsumer, Apple is gaining momentum in digital ads, while Google and Facebook appear to be losing steam.

Apples search ads let people advertise on the iPhone makers App Store. Advertiser adoption rate for the second quarter rose almost 4 percentage points from a year earlier to 94.8%, while Facebook adoption fell 3 percentage points to 82.8%, Appsumer said. Googles rate declined 2 points to 94.8%.\\n\\nApple has joined the duopoly of Facebook and Google at the top table of advertiser adoption, according to Appsumer, which is owned by InMobi.

Their return is astronomical. \\n\\nThat led me to think about apple as well. Both are consumer products and have that it factor captivating the audience. \\n\\nI wonder whats the next. Some say its palantir but I think it lacks that sexy appeal to direct consumers. \\n\\nps\\n\\nCant edit the title. Im asking NEW stocks. Not the one listed above. \\n\\nLets not talk about Teslas PE ratio.\\n\\npps\\nThanks for sharing your opinions. Some think its silly but I think its valid. I listen to earning calls and try to evaluate companies from financial perspective as well. But we cant deny the fact that popularity and a fan base play a big role as well. \\n\\nJust trying to find a jackpot and maybe invest 1% of my portfolio. \\n\\nPpps \\nI added Spotify because I thought it was one of the market disruptors. It may not have bright future as other companies but I do think it cha'",

     "it could be that there is no other apple or tesla at this time. It's not like there was a new \"apple\" or \"tesla\" every year. They are literally unicorns and they come around very rarely...also most people wouldn't recognize them early on. It only becomes evident in hindsight after the stock blows up and then you kick yourself for not buying earlier."

     "I mean it's possible you will have a company rise from the grave like Apple. You have to remember what a big piece of shit that was until the first iPod and iPhone. Steve reinvigorated that company. I mean it was dead weight even through the 90s and into the early 2000s. So the first option is a company that rebuilds itself into something like that. Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market. Right now it's commodities, but commodity cycles never last that long. I think 2005 to 2008 was probably one of the longer ones"

Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?\n\nTrouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.\n\nMSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.\n\n\nWhat you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?\n\nAs for something else, I wish I knew.  What's the problem that needs to be solved, and who's solving it in some clever way?"

While these are small applications that won\u2019t convince most investors, NVIDIA has pivoted in recent years to completely embrace artificial intelligence and deep learning and are moving the company in that direction. Once self driving cars, automated traffic and smart factories become the norm, you can expect NVIDIA to be even more of a juggernaut in the tech industry."

     "Like you said in your edit, it's most likely not already a big 500b+ company like the ones in your title.\n\nMy call is it will be NIO. [Here](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/inside-chinas-electric-drive-swappable-car-batteries-2022-03-24/) is an article that reflects my thinking. The whole EV industry acts as if fast charging is going to \"improve\" and that battery swapping is irrelevant. Those who make those claims completely miss the point and ignore reality. Charging speed could improve, but it could also get worse. \"How is that possible?\" you and every moron Telsa Boi might ask. Well, it's simple. There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The \"longest range\" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.\n\nAlso, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to \"grow\" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..\n\nIn the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say \"I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla\""

     "Delisting doesn't really mean much. Many stocks go through delisting and increase in share price post-delisting... It does mean less liquidity because some brokers won't allow OTC trading, but the big ones like Fidelity and TD Ameritrade do. \n\nThe reason it's at $0.13 and not higher is not because it's delisting or going bankrupt. If it were just doing those two things, I would be buying a lot more. Once bankruptcy protection is in place, they won't have any debt and could theoretically continue operations. The reason it's 13 cents is because they're also closing all their stores (by end of May). If they close all their stores, they will also have no income... Point is, delisting and bankruptcy does not mean the company ceases to exist. It will still trade OTC and have some inherent brand value. \n\nThere is also a chance of a buyout of some kind, most likely occurring after bankruptcy procedures are complete, but before closing of stores. The total market cap is around $50m. Once bankruptcy is complete, and debts are erased, any rich guy with a couple hundo sitting around could decide they want to take over, install their son Johnny Tsunami as the CEO, help their son Johnny with the turnaround, then talk to their friend at Walmart and get them to hire Johnny as the WMT CEO. You could construct any number of similar opportunities, but point is, $50m is a low enough price that some nobody could easily buy up a controlling interest in the company. If I had a billion $, I would buy it all today, scrap it for parts, and basically just set up a couple stores using the brand name. I'd cut costs by selling cheaper products at a higher markup. Guess what, BBBY did over $20b in revenue last year. They also spent $20b, but that's still a lot of revenue that I could potentially cut costs on. All I need to do is cut costs by less than half a percent and then I'm generating $50m in profit each year. By owning 100% I can just pay the $50m as a dividend and I get all of it - every year. Pretty amazing return."

So here's the thing: some investors just can't resist the temptation of buying bankrupt stocks because they're like moths to a flame when it comes to speculation, potential asset sales, or even the slightest chance of a company bouncing back. They see those dirt-cheap shares and think, \"Hey, what if they turn things around?\" But let's be real\u2014playing with bankrupt stocks is like walking on thin ice. It's risky as hell, and you might end up with a big fat zero if the company goes under for good. Remember, when the bankruptcy Grim Reaper comes knocking, equity holders are usually the last in line to get paid. So yeah, it's a gamble, but some people just can't resist the thrill."

     "The +27% intraday move when apple gave them a shout-out during their vision pro presentation just solidified for me that investors don't really understand unity that well. Imo it's not that big of a deal, unity is already big in the VR market and the thing with vision pro proooobably won't affect them as a company that much. There's plenty of other stuff to be excited about with unity, and I feel that investors are sleeping on it a bit. I guess it's out of caution because they had some rough moments in 2022. But I also can't help but think that the company is also a bit misunderstood. If a new VR headset being announced can send the stock flying, I'm looking forward to the next couple years when we see actual noteworthy stuff coming from Unity that will have a more tangible impact on their business.\n\nOf course all of this is nonsense talk if they don't have the tech to back it all up. But I'm confident in unity and how they're positioning themselves long-term. It's a great engine, but it's not even only about the engine itself. It's not only about the consumer-facing side of the business either (games), which is what people tend to think of when they think of Unity. In my opinion, in the long term, it's about the increasing prevalence of realtime 3d as an important tool for a growing number of industries. It's about Unity's moat as one of the few full featured, user friendly realtime 3d engines, and by few I mean their only true competition is unreal engine. I'm sorry Godot users. I'm sorry anyone who thinks AAA studios and their (decreasingly used) proprietary engines offer any real notable competition in this space. Making a game engine has always been hard, but it's getting harder, and the further the technology evolves the bigger the moat is gonna get.\n\nIn the long term I see unity spreading its wings as a 3d software ecosystem that encompasses a variety of (likely paid) tools, and likely with a heavy lean into AI. I also see more industries using these kinds of tools in ways that might not be obvious today.\n\nOther companies in this space that get me excited include Nvidia, which I own a bunch of (I lump summed a few years ago), and adobe, but adobe is a little too risky for me since they are already pretty mature as a company, and some of their existing software is falling out of favor. Idk, I'm on the fence about investing in them. Unity is the only company in this space that seems worth accumulating at these prices. I started buying a year ago and am long @$35 a share average."

I'm still down though, but the plan is to keep them for a decade.\n\nUnity has a great product which I know very well from my career. The company is by far the best positioned to take advantage of many current and coming supertrends. I think the whole world will eventually go RT3D. \n\nThe trouble is dilution. It's one of the single most dilutive stocks I've ever seen. My original shares from IPO at like $69 would be worth $31 now if the company value has stayed the same (which it hasn't).\n\nI've written a TON about them on my investment blog, which is linked in my profile - covered every earnings in my monthly journals and written two entire dedicated posts.\n\nGreat company with an incredible future, but it remains to be seen if shareholders will be rewarded for that, and not just mangement. Be wary.\n\nPersonally, I'm not buying more shares until the dilution is better under control and the company turns profitable or at least cash flow positive. Those things go hand in hand - without SBC they are already profitable.\n\nI liked the ironSource deal - many didn't.

     "I've had very negative outlook on their business and don't see much prospect in them.\n\n* Their CEO is a dipshit who was in charge of EA for years, aka the most consistently voted worst companies in the industry. Said dipshit also called his customers \"fucking idiots\" for not including predatory MTX as part of their business model. Great leadership amirite.\n* Last I saw they shut down their help forums, which is very bad for onboarding new users. Not great for expanding revenue.\n* I've pretty consistently heard from others their product has been circling the drain for years with one pointless half finished feature after another. They're operating in the red to develop and then abandon features.\n* As for myself I find their engine to be cumbersome as hell to use and I vastly prefer Godot which has exploded in popularity over the last few years and is extremely nice to work in while also allowing devs to keep 100% of revenue. Unity is rapidly losing its niche as the go to engine for indies. There was actually a huge outflux of users from /r/unity and /r/gamedev to /r/godot as a result of the above two points last year. As games take multiple years to develop the delayed effects of this are hard to measure, but I don't see it as a positive for unity.\n* VR/AR is a hilariously overrated niche that's hard to develop for and represents an exceedingly small amount of the industry's revenue. Every year for the last decade people have been saying it will take off and it never does. A $3k headset certainly isn't going to change that. Maybe in X years it finally will take off, who knows, but I doubt unity will be the one to invest in for that kind of revolution."

     "You should recognise that although Google represents itself as a technology company, by revenue, it's an advertising company. About 80% of its revenue. I can't find what percentage of that is from paid search, but I imagine it's quite large.\n\nThe search engine format has barely changed in 25 years. People might argue about algorithms and efficiency and relevancy bla bla, but the basic structure is there. And the basic format where companies outbid each other to get to the top ad slots to be the first impression still stands.\n\nNow go to Edge and use Microsoft's new chat feature to find out the information you want. It completes a search, analyses the information from multiple sources, and summarizes it to you WITH references. It's VASTLY more efficient than the old search engine style. I'm only going to go back to search as a last resort. Its also only available in Edge so now Chrome is redundant. Which means no more building profiles of what websites you search in the background. It's only a matter of time until people realise this.\n\nGoogle can catch up to microsoft pretty easily by having bard do the same, but the problem for Google remains. Their core revenue driver is no longer relevant. Microsoft had so little share of the paid search space that it has everything to gain and nothing to lose. Google needs to come up with a brand new way of shoving ads in your face AND make the experience better than Bing which isnt doing any of that. That's going to be hard. They had 25 years to revolutionise search, and they never touched it because it was always their golden goose that they didn't want to break.\n\nSo I think google is going to face serious headwinds in terms of their core revenue drivers. They will survive, but its going to be painful. They got complacent. The tortoise overtook the hare while he was resting on his laurels."

     "I did pretty similar to you, bought 50 shares when meta was around 90 but I sold at 260. Was always a short term play for me though, I\u2019d rather hold the nasdaq than shares of meta now that they\u2019ve recovered from their absurdly low valuation.\n\nHindsight and all but I wish I would have put much more into meta. Meta at $90 and a p/e of 13 was probably one of the biggest opportunities I\u2019ve seen in a long time."

     "> TikTok has impeding ban US-wide and possibly Europe\n\nThough a safer way to play this is to sell some Meta for Google which would also benefit from TikTok ban. That's what I did personally after Meta popped at $240\n\n> Apple VR intro imminent next week, could crater Meta depending on what Apple reveals\n\nThe VR market is so small that I think Apple is more likely to expand the total addressable market than they are to take market share from Meta. More VR headset manufacturers leads to more VR developers who will probably develop for both platforms. Biggest problem right now is that there's really no compelling application to use VR, not that Meta's devices are limiting, maybe Apple developers can change that, who knows. \n\nWall Street also hates VR so maybe Apple stock will crater after they announce their investment into it.\n\n> Facebook is essentially a dead platform among zoomers and younger\n\nBut it doesn't really matter whether people are on Insta or Facebook"

It is out of date and I added some updates, but I think it gives a 'longer term' outlook and reason to be bullish. I own shares at $170. \n\n\n> META has:\n> \n> - Essentially no debt (40B in total liabilities, of which 12B is long term debt. 21B in current liabilities, 1B of which is current debt).

[Edit: Reduced shares 5% YoY last quarter, doing $9B with $40B authorized as of end of Q1]\n> - It's forecast to grow between 9-15% the next few years, compared to the past decade of 20 to 40% growth. If it beats that, I'd expect a large revision upwards of the stock price.

I certainly am not interested, it is just a bonus if it works.\n> - Reels could displace TikTok especially if there is a ban (see FCC remarks on TikTok). TikTok is spyware!\n> - Companies like META have some of the best talent in AI/machine learning, and these skills transfer to a variety of profit-generating services. A similar case is there for GOOG and MSFT. You get high quality employees at companies like this.\n> - The uncertainty/fear around META is more than made up for by the valuations.

     "The East India Company. \n\nA group of relatively small time investors met in London ~1600, to jointly fund an expedition to the far East to directly procure oriental goods and sell them direct to the English market. Prior to this, the goods had to pass through and be taxed by the ports of the French or Dutch kingdoms, meaning the goods had high final cost in London. \n\nAt the time, the UK was a proverbial backwater of Europe. The Dutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese kingdoms were far richer and more influential. From a global perspective, the far East, India and china particularly, was much richer and more developed than Europe. \n\nThe first voyage, the EIC ship stumbled upon a Portuguese vessel returning to Europe with 1200 tons in goods. The EIC ship engaged in piracy, sacked the Portuguese ship, and returned to London with the booty. This first haul was so profitable, it provided huge returns for the investors. And drove significant investor interest. This set up the EIC for early growth. Growth was soon funded by the issue and broad public sale of shares. \n\nOver the next 250 years the EIC would grow to be the largest and most influential company in the world. Eventually amassing an enormous army of more than 200,000 soldiers, de facto ruling over the entire Indian subcontinent and beyond. The purpose of which was to monopolize the trade of all of India. At one point, EIC trade accounted for 1/4 of the English economy. \n\nThe EIC grew so large that the power of the company threatened English democracy, and they had to be dismantled. and India taken over by the British government and administered as a colony. But britain, the country, didn't conquer India, the EIC did. \n\nThe rise of the EIC and the volume of wealth it generated was a major factor in the rise of Britain, from a weak, small and far flung isolated island nation, to a global powerhouse. This wealth was the primary source of capital that drove Britains other expeditions and colonization of the rest of the world. The effects of this rise to power continue to shape the world today. \n\nIf there had been no EIC, chances are we wouldnt be sitting here communicating in English. The USA potentially wouldn't exist as we know it. Global history over the last 400 years would have played out very differently."

     "I'm seeing many already established, often outlandishly high P/E companies here that would have been a good investment some time ago.\n\nFull Disclosure: I own shares in the company that I will now briefly talk about. I consider it a great investment right now (I'm not responsible for any losses).\n\nWestlake Chemical Corporation (WCC). First let us talk about past performance and financial metrics. WCC over the last 10 years has shown a 10 year median return of ROE of 21,4% and a ROIC of 14,5%. When one considered the ROIC it seems like a company that seems rather cyclical and is rather sensitive to major crisis (ROIC 2008=-1.67% and 2019/20= +3-4%). That 14,5% is with the years of corona included. So the upside is a generally high ROIC, but a high variance of the ROIC. The company has been profitable 19 out of the last 20 years (with the year of unprofitability being the banking crisis in 2008). So the return side looks solid, even if I'd rather have less cyclicality.\nLet us consider the growth. The story here is similar. 10-year average growth rates are 16% for revenue, 19,7% on assets, 26,2% of FCF and 19,7% for EPS. It is nice that ROE is mostly greater than the growth rates, indicating that the growth is sustainable. This growth also seems not to driven only by aquisitions and the issuence of debt. There have been two aquisitions made and in parts financed by debt in the last 10 years and the business is far from overly leveraged ($4.88B debt and $2.23B cash on hand with a marketcap of $15.1B). The 10 year median margins I do not know enough about to compare to industry standarts, but they seem high with Gross profit margin of 24,4%, EBIT 18.1% and FCF-margin of 11.1%. Maybe someone more knowledgeable about the industry can weigh in here. The company is also buying back shares, even if not at an emormous rate.\n\nAnd all of that for a P/E of 6,8.\n\nTo me that seems like a conservatively run company, by a management that makes sensible and careful business decisions, with good profitability and good growth and low debt. For me this is a \"no-brainer\" stock, although it isn't perfect, which is why i have just recently bought the stock and gave it significant weight in my portfolio. A personal problem is that I do not know enough about plastics and coatings, which is their business, but every other metric checks out for me.\n\nI would be happy to hear any criticism of the company, as it then might improve how I look at companies in the future. Good luck and thanks :)"

When the economy gets better, I'm expecting to see Roku deliver outsized revenue growth when ad budgets return to the industry and Roku will also have a higher share of that larger budget. Another upside item is 2024 Presidential Election, a lot of ad dollars will be spent next year that not a lot of analysts are pricing in. Finally base case is rate cuts will be happening in early '24 so Roku & other tech stocks should respond with higher stock prices in late '23 as the Fed pivot becomes more clear."

People purely love apple for its aesthetic, \"celebrity status\" and easy to use OS, which masks the list of issues in its design and limited lifetime use. If only the cost actually reflected what you got.\n\nThe swing to android has slowly started to increase as their phones continue to prove valuable and durable.\n\nImo, and this is not financial advice. Ride the apple stock train but watch for the social clues to know when to jump. Proven by pictures, meetings and documents of hedgefunds, Apple talks quite often with big hedgefunds (such as citadel). Theres now way they would let Apple tank."

It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.\\n\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-its-ai-supercomputer-is-faster-greener-than-nvidia-2023-04-05/\\n\\nFundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused o\"",

     "Is time to recover this gem written by Peter Lynch. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*If you remember nothing else about p/e ratios, remember to avoid stocks with excessively high ones. You\u2019ll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*\r  \n\r  \n*A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that\u2019s been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald\u2019s was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald\u2019s could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn\u2019t anything wrong with McDonald\u2019s. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*\r  \n\r  \n*And if McDonald\u2019s was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot\u2019s company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*\r  \n\r  \n*If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you\u2019d just be breaking even today.*\r  \n\r  \n*I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: \u201cDue to the recent bankruptcy, we\u2019re removing this stock from our buy list.\u201d In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I\u2019ve ever seen before or since.*\r  \n\r  \n*You often hear about companies whose future performance is \u201cdiscounted\u201d in the stock price. If that\u2019s the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*\r  \n\r  \n*When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64\u2014though nowhere near as extreme as EDS\u2019s. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It\u2019s a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon\u2019s earnings didn\u2019t grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18\u215d in 1974.*\r  \n\r  \n*The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*\r  \n\r  \n*The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14\u215b in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid\u2019s p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*\r  \n\r  \n*Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn\u2019t have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*"

Here's some bullet points of why:\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nCovid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.\r  \n\r  \nAI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.\r  \n\r  \nHigh Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.\r  \n\r  \nInsider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years. The worst is that the CFO is now doing it which is the one person in the company that knows best about valuations.\r  \n\r  \nIf you want more details you can watch my video on YouTube by searching 'NVDA TickerTaco'."

Therefore, I'd rather throw $10k at a gamble like this with 300-1000% upside if it works, than throw $50k at puts that expire 6-12 months from now with 50-200% upside. I know I'm simplifying the greeks drastically, but the essence is that if timing is impossible, might as well risk less capital for higher upside potential. If the first $10k position blows up, this gives me the opportunity to sit back, relax, and wait to potentially reload another position in the near future.\n\nWhereas if I got the entry price wrong for a larger, deeper put - they will have lost 30-60% of their value anyway. From a psychology perspective, it's much easier for me to dismiss a smaller position loss and cut my chasing rather than hoping for my large, bleeding position to recoup it's value. Waiting for deep OTM puts to recover is mentally exhausting and draining."

     "SCHW deposits fell almost $140B or 30%.  Yet street remains positive, very interesting.\n\nI guess the thesis is that there are enough people comfortably being scammed (or unaware?) with 0% APY on their stock brokerage cash that it is sustainable eventually.\n\nI expect retail deposits for normal banking to be stable at 0%.  Most people have only a few thousand dollars in their accounts and don't pay super close attention to yield.  That said, I would think the sensitivity to be higher for active investors but maybe I am wrong on this.\n\nEdit: u/AP9384629344432 to clarify I agree most people don't move checking money.  My point is that SCHW gets almost all their deposits by screwing over their trading accounts not checking.\n\nSo not sure which broker you use but I use Fidelity.  All my cash gets swept to 4.5% MMF at the end of every day if I don't use it.\n\nSCHW on the other hand sweeps it to their subsidiary Schwab Bank for 0.4% and treats it as a deposit, does that make sense?  As a bank holding company they have to keep them separate but can have affiliate relationships.  I am surprised that SCHW traders are okay with this.  This is how Schwab funds their loan portfolio from their 10K:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/DhmSkN2.png\n\nIt is almost entirely funded by traders that are not using their cash at all.  I would think they are among the most volatile deposit bases out there??  But apparently I am wrong."

But I have to say, the more anecdotal use cases that I\u2019m seeing at my employer, the more I\u2019m finding myself starting to buy into the hype. My years of experience are telling me to keep the guardrails up any time there is hype.\n\nI was a brand new investor during the dot com bust and I remember the feeling of invincibility picking stocks that would double and triple.  There didn\u2019t seem any way to screw it up until the rug pull and multi year grind downwards.  Overall I basically lost just about everything I had put in during that period with the exception of a couple boring stock picks that I still own to this day. Think really boring lol. \n\nEven though the stock market went bust back then, the tech revolution that has followed is undeniable. Market caps have swelled beyond anything folks would have thought possible.\n\nI wanted to bring this piece of my experience up because the hype feels of a similar quality\u2026not exactly the same, but the early innings hype is there nonetheless.\n\nEvery once in a while there comes along the potential for a paradigm shift in how society functions. Society and institutions are slow moving beasts and change can only be integrated at a certain pace. The potential is there right now for this to kick into overdrive.\n\nWhat does this do for the stock market? I\u2019m really not sure. Maybe we get another tech bust after a massive run-up. What I am feeling pretty sure of is the returns over the next 10-20 years are looking really good."

     "[Here are credit card utilization rates among American households](https://i.imgur.com/46ZNjWy.png). Americans post-Covid were *not* maxing out their credit cards anymore than in 2019. \n\nWe did see credit spending increase the last 2 years. Many said this was evidence of 'consumers entering debt because of a tough economy' while others (myself included) argued this was consumers showing resilience.\n\nNow, at the tail end of that graph and alongside retail sales weakening, we see credit card usage going down. To me, *this* is a sign of weakness. And if you argued Americans were debt-binging, well this is a positive trend to you (I don't think it is).\n\nWhat's your narrative?\n\nNecessary graphs (some of these are slightly out of date):\n\n- [Revolving debt as a share of income](https://i.imgur.com/Ovbuz49.png)\n- [Household debt payments as percent of income](https://i.imgur.com/jkoRNqt.png)\n- [Household debt to GDP](https://i.imgur.com/DvoDsJk.png), and compared to [trends around the world](https://i.imgur.com/3AJAdq8.png).\n- [Household checkings savings](https://i.imgur.com/ElKgOoL.png)\n\nBy the way, separate from households, but [non-financial corporate interest expenses](https://i.imgur.com/0gG7KcT.png) as a share of operating cash flow have actually been falling over the past few decades (with some spikes in the Dot-Com / housing bubbles). \n\nAnd [here is household financial obligations](https://i.imgur.com/4IRzafn.png) (debt, leases, property taxes and rents) as a share of disposable income (= after-tax income)\n\n[Thread from Carl Quintanilla](https://twitter.com/carlquintanilla/status/1645875520264114178) here with many other graphs.\n\nTo emphasize, I'm talking about *American* households only in this comment--I'm aware global debt has increased to unhealthy levels in many other countries."

Is Apple trying to become a bank?

Why not just buy back more shares or put toward the primary business which are actually doing well. JPMorgan has a fortress balance sheet but I don't think they should be getting into self driving cars.\n\nMaybe unrelated but I see a sentiment whenever companies announce 'expansions' or 'new acquisitions' and everyone's first take is: \"ooh exciting, idk what this has implications for but business is growing, buy buy buy.\" Elon Musk is disrupting the restaurant sector!! Amazon is going to take over the drone space!"

     "I have been seeing YouTubers, Redditors, and CNBC bring on a bunch of \u201cexperts\u201d talking about this upcoming earnings. You would think with all this talk about it if Apple misses it would mean the end of the entire market. People are going crazy about it right now and this is my opinion.\n\nApple has always had periods of booms and busts. One year would be really great and the next meh. It has always been like this. The last 2 years have been phenomenal for them so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if we see a slowdown in electronic sales. Right now computer sales have had a big decline across the world. We see this in the Microsoft earnings. Microsoft did really bad in their computers and general hardware in their recent earnings. \n\nWith all this will it surprise me that Apple misses? No. Will it be the heat death of the universe if they do? No. Will it surprise me if Apple beats either? No. Apple has always had a history of beating peoples expectations and it would not surprise me if hardware sales do not decline as much as Microsoft\u2019s due to the strength that the Apple ecosystem has shown in the past.\n\nApple has also been moving more towards subscriptions and financial services. Very high margins and so far has been growing every single quarter. This can probably also soften the blow if there is a decline in the hardware side of their business. \n\nThe way I look at it is whatever happens happens. If we see a beat I am ok with it. If we see a decline I am also ok with it. I can see it going both ways however I want to lean more towards a miss. Apple is currently approaching all time highs and I would love to see the stock pull back some so I can add to my current position."

(I am quoting)\n\nIf a stock goes up a buck, the delta is the correlation between that price increase and the option price.  Options are cheaper than stocks so it's not 1 to 1 but gets closer to 1 to 1 if it gets closer to the strike price.\n\nBeta is a measure of a stock's volatility.  Delta calls in this case are playing off bulls continually buying the dip because they are relentlessly doing so.  \n\nSPX is therefore reacting negatively to having any company but Apple in its index.\n\nTL;DR: All of the S&P that isn't Apple is more volatile because Apple Bulls are relentless.  Other portions of the S&P are capitulating at a rate higher than Apple.\n\nMy guess: foreign money is relentlessly buying Apple dips.  The Federal Reserve doesn't want this and Apple is extraordinarily expensive in non-US currency.  Apple is turning into a foreign Treasury fund.  Eventually American fund capitulation will show up when foreign money dries up.  This will further slaughter foreign currencies.  Europe's piper will be paid in losses unless they meaningfully act as the emerging market the European Union has basically turned into.  Manufacturing is rushing out of Europe for basically anywhere.  Furloughs are going to happen.  This shrinks the tax base.\n\nIt's crazy what this means Apple stock has become.  If BRK capitulates watch the fuck out.  Because they very well could and start buying Europe or England.  And I say this based off Buffet's famous be greedy when others are fearful."

     "> things people need everyday\n\nThe smartphone is something central in our live nowadays, so i think your premise is wrong there.\n\n____________________\n\nThe thing with apple imo is that they managed to get in a position where they can have insane profit margins. Maybe not the best source (just the first result i found), but [this article](https://www.imore.com/apple-takes-75-smartphone-profits-despite-13-market-share-says-report) say they captured 75% of all profits in the smartphone market, despite a much much lower share of units sold.\n\nFurther more they are extremely good in drawing and keeping people in their ecosystem. Once you e.g. have an iphone you are also likely go get a mac, ipad or airpods (those actually make a ton of money). And on the service side they get a 30% cut from the app store and you are likely to use icloud or appleTV over competitors.\n\nCopare that for example to Sony which at the start of a new generation often sells their consoles at a loss for some time (and then makes up for it in taking a cut on game sales and stuff)."

Their market cap has tripled when their revenues/profits have only doubled, meaning the stock is getting more and more expensive.  At some point they are going to approach the limits of growth and their share price will drop because future growth gets priced-in, so I guess the key thing is to try to get in earlier, ride the wave up, and then enjoy the juicy dividends as they become a cash flow machine instead of a growth machine.  That is still years off and so there's still time to get in, even if it is getting pricey right now.  It's just that there might be opportunities with short-term pullbacks."

Some reasons why:\\n\\n* Nvidia\\'s advancements is going to \"democratize AI\" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.\\n\\n* I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.\\n\\n* I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple & Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.\\n\\nWould love your opinions.

IMO if hardware for machine learning gets cheaper all that will happen is big companies will buy more of it and use it to train models with more parameters, or train more models at once for hyperparameter selection. I don't see how it would narrow the divide, unless the big models hit diminishing returns."

And telling them they can no longer grow any more is just about the most anti-American statement anyone can make.\n\nSo what if they control a lot of retail? Where was the outrage when big box stores were the only players in town and it cost a fortune to open a brick and mortar making it impossible to compete? None of those big stores gave you the option of consignment. All of them imported most of their stuff post 80s. All of them had unwritten agreements about pricing or was it a coincidence that a shirt costs the same today as it did 30 years ago? Goes to show what their margins were.\n\nAt least now you can compete. Making a website is very cheap and marketing is many time cheaper thanks to the various ways it can be done. Back in the day, all you had was print, tv and radio and it costs thousands a month to get any sort of views. Now you get the same for hundreds.\n\nSo cry me a river. If it wasnt Amazon then it would have been Walmart. If wasnt Walmart then it would have been someone else."

He went long on GOOGL and META while short on AAPL as there was a valuation gap as AAPL corrected the least during the last several legs down, which created a valuation gap btw it and other big techs, which should close. This thesis has proved to be correct and already played out. Burry was not the only one on this trade. Many macro funds spot the divergence and made similar trades.\n\nThis play has the beauty of being market neutral (if sized correctly), which was exactly what the doctor ordered during a volatile period like 1H2022. \n\nBurry likely already liquidated the AAPL shorts and the GOOGL and META longs."

When news about Teslas crashing because of distracted drivers came out, my dad and I talked about how completely misleading it was to market their vehicles as being \"self-driving\" or having an \"autopilot\" feature. Sure, [from an engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot) \"autopilot\" technically means some level of human piloting is still occurring...but to the average layperson, the word colloquially implies that the machine doesn't need to be supervised (i.e. saying that someone is \"operating on autopilot\" means that they're distracted).\n\nEven if the engineers had wanted to call it an \"autopilot\" feature, the marketers and lawyers should have stepped in and overridden them. I normally argue that consumers should be responsible for understanding what they're buying, but I can absolutely understand why someone would purchase a car and assume that the car was totally autonomous. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them assumed that the instructions that did warn them to pay attention to the road were just legalese to cover Tesla's ass instead of serious warnings."

     "Based on the conversation here, a thought about timing the market:\n\nIf the time before you will need the money is counted in years, then it is possible to time the market with a degree of success. If, by historical measures, the market is undervalued by a standard deviation or more, you own stocks and you keep holding until such time as the market approaches being over-valued by a standard deviation, at which point you start to trim. The higher the market goes from there, the more you trim, and as the market approaches being over-valued by two standard deviations, you get out.\n\nI'm being specific to make my example concrete. The principle is that if stocks begin to look more like speculation than investment, you get out.\n\nIn a world of black swans, this plan can fail you, but this is at least a version of timing the market that makes use of the notion that over a time scale of years, it is possible to assess whether the market is \\*likely\\* to return more than alternative holdings.\n\nTwo things can screw this up badly. One is that you are investing in a very small number of individual companies. The risk of a surprising event, in either direction, is considerable for an individual company. The fewer your holdings, the more potential there is for the company to be subject to something wonderful or awful.\n\nThe other thing that can screw it up is normal, short-term volatility. In the short term, the market is driven more by emotion than reason. If you're talking about a handful of trading days, emotion can trump reason significantly. If a market drops 20% over six months, that likely reflects a change in conditions. But the daily swings up and down on the way there will be many multiples of 20% and will be the result of how market participants are feeling about the market on that particular day.\n\nTechnical analysis aims to capture those changes in sentiment, and technical analysis can be successful if it's predictive for slightly better than half the time. Technical analysis will thus be wrong \\*close to\\* half the time at least, and the shorter the time frame, the worse it will perform.\n\nSo the shorter the time frame and the smaller the number of stock issues being considered, the less there is to reliably say about where the price may go next. To hold on to shares with money that you're going to need in less than a year is speculating, not investing.\n\nAnyone can get surprised by an unexpected need for cash, but that's also something to consider before buying shares."

Both were useful for enabling digital transactions in a world before the internet and prior to the invention of digital currencies, but today all they do is extract value from economic activity while yielding monopolistic power over our transactions.\n\nIn the coming years I wouldn't be surprised to see a continued push for tech that disrupts and works around the need for traditional payment processors. I also think you'll see some countries adopting digital currencies which will allow consumers and businesses to transfer funds to each other directly without the need for middlemen.\n\nThen again, given their size and influence it seems unlikely that this would happen in the West. I see them both as having solid moats as of right now, but I also don't understand the value these companies deliver to the consumer which makes me nervous to invest. I don't think anyone uses V or MA because they want to, we use these companies because we're forced to. As an investor that's great if you're happy to assume in the future consumers will continue to have no other options, but should that change it's not like anyone has any loyalty or love for their payment processor.\n\nPersonally for a long-term hold I'd rather stick with a company like KO which has some loyalty and isn't at risk of technological disruption."

Do your own bet and good luck.\n\nMy take: I'm long both on Google and Apple. For me the news would be bullish on Google (they will save cash) and neutral on Apple (they now have to either continuing offering the same service without the gains from Google or look for another provider that will likely provide a worse service).\n\nPerhaps they decide to invest on their own solution instead (Apple search). What happens then? some people will be bullish with the idea. However, I think I will turn bearish since I don't think Apple can release any good service outside of its own walled garden (and for a search engine you need to go outside)"

  "Text": "b'https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-27/apple-to-let-iphones-accept-credit-cards-without-extra-hardware\\n\\nApple Inc. is planning a new service that will let small businesses accept payments directly on their iPhones without any extra hardware, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\\n\\nThe company has been working on the new feature since around 2020, when it paid about $100 million for a Canadian startup called Mobeewave that developed technology for smartphones to accept payments with the tap of a credit card. The system will likely use the iPhones near field communications, or NFC, chip that is currently used for Apple Pay.\\n\\nn order to accept payments on an iPhone today, merchants need to use payment terminals that plug in or communicate with the phone via Bluetooth. The upcoming feature will instead turn the iPhone into a payment terminal, letting users such as food trucks and hair stylists accept payments with the tap of a credit card or another iPhone onto the '",

     "I actually commercially trialled this exact feature on Android smart phones about five years ago now. It's trivial to do this with encryption and NFC. I was working for a big payments company at the time. \n\nOur conclusion was that because it's NFC only, and because you are using someone else's phone screen to input data (so entering your PIN is impossible) that it's not viable for any transactions over the NFC limit which at the time was $100.\n\nSo yeah, it's cool for maybe taking a transaction when you sell your ebay item or selling your potatoes at the market or your friend wants to pay their split of lunch, but it's not going to make anyone rich. The margins are so tiny on credit card transactions and this product is limited to very small transactions so at the end of the day it's basically a gimmick."

     "I don't think this will bite into Square's market share as much as people may think.\n\nBusiness owners have so many other variables to consider besides \"what's the cheapest way for me to take card payments\u201d. Square has already offered free phone readers for years, so it's not like there's been a high barrier to entry. Plus there's a reason why most businesses elect for the more traditional payment terminals or registers (security, professionalism, etc). This will only affect the tiny businesses selling at the farmers market or a mall stand (who already likely have a free square reader and would need to switch).\n\nThis isn\u2019t even accounting for the entire Square ecosystem of business features that no one else can offer (and is their main selling point)."

     "I used Square for my coffee shop for a few years. The terminals they came out with were great and the fees were \u201cacceptable\u201d compared to others. The back end inventory management and reports were very helpful. Using the iPad before was a real pain in the ass with constant updates and other nonsense issues. It\u2019s not a business I could run with an iPhone, as people still use cash and I needed an actual drawer. The market is already saturated with merchants services and it\u2019s a pain in the ass to change everything over, even for a small shop. Might be fine for a single self employed individual."

     "I've posted on some other comments here, but just want to say that Apple's entry into the electronics payments on the seller-side does not mean it's automatically going to dominate and put Square and other fintechs out of business. First, while SQ's original business was the credit card payment terminal that you could attach to your phone, it's grown far beyond that over the years. SQ doesn't just provide a payment terminal for small businesses, it provides services that are needed for running and growing the business: keeping track of inventory, payroll, insurance, taxes, reward programs, and even loans. So if I am a small business owner relying on SQ's services, I'm not going to start using Apple's payment terminal and abandon SQ unless they provide something equivalent in terms of business services at a similar cost. I'm not familiar with what Apple plans to do besides what's written in the above article, but I don't think they've set the groundwork to provide such services.\n\nSecond, SQ's business has also grown beyond the seller-side with the Cash App digital wallet becoming a multi-billion dollar business. Not going to go into detail about that here, but I think it's important to remember how diverse SQ's business has become in about a decade. Obviously there's competition and risk, that's true with investing in any company, but I do think that SQ will be a long term winner in the fintech space."

These are all things that was suppose to disrupt their industries because \"It's Apple\" but if anything its made tiny dents in those industries and to be honest I think that is all Cook is looking for, more revenue stream. Square has more things to worry about than just Apple like other startup competitors who want to build ecosystems on par with Squares or the 'head in the clouds' CEO, which unlike jobs who had his head in the clouds as well, just doesn't have the same focus and intuition as Jobs did in the second half of his career.

Read this explanation first:**\\n\\n>ARM licenses its [ISA](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets) and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.  \\nApple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.  \\nYes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.  \\nStock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them \"",

Family of Apps:\n\nRevenue:\n\n2021: 32.8 billion\n\n2022: 31.4 billion (-4%)\n\nNet Income:\n\n2021: 15.9 billion\n\n2022: 10.7 billion (-33%)\n\n2. Reality Labs ( this is the one of they are supposed to be growing and are sinking a ton of money into)\n\nRevenue:\n\n2021: 877 million\n\n2022: 727 million (-17%)\n\nNet income:\n\n2021: -3.3 billion\n\n2022: -4.3 billion (-23%)\n\nThe losses from their Reality segments has really accelerated and they currently spent around 9 billion dollars of Capex compared to last years quarter which was around 5.4 billion.\n\nOverall looking at the fundamentals its still pretty ugly. The balance sheet also got a bit uglier from their current assets taking a big dip due to the cash they\u2019re burning on this Reality Labs investment. Both current liabilities and total liabilities took a sizable increase. The good news is that they can afford these hits due to the balance sheet being clean. \n\nThe stock is still down over 50% from its highs even after this after hours jump. My guess is that either the stock has already so much bad news priced into it that people just really don\u2019t care about these losses. Most likely its the 40 billion stock buyback that causing the stock to balloon after hours which is a buyback that will eliminate 10% of their total shares. There could have also been guidance that I did not see as I did not listen to the earnings call.\n\nOverall very ugly quarter from a fundamental standpoint. Not interested in the stock and especially not interested after the after hours move lol. Just going to continue to stay away and continue to let Zuckerberg bleed money on these ridiculous goggles that nobody is buying."

     "As someone who\u2019s been watching all 3 recently, here\u2019s my take on what will happen.\n\n1. Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we\u2019re gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I\u2019m sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.\n\n2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don\u2019t think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they\u2019d grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it\u2019s actually pretty fairly priced where it\u2019s at. \n\n3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It\u2019s about 60% off it\u2019s ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it\u2019s a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn\u2019t been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi\u2019s really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they\u2019re undervalued, so they\u2019re buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.\n\nOf these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.\n\nI think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They\u2019ve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come. AMD is in the same boat, but just more undervalued across the board, and therefore has less room to fall. Apple is by far the safest play, I would say. But that doesn\u2019t mean a 20% drop couldn\u2019t happen over the next few months.\n\nDisclaimer: I hold substantial amounts of all three stocks listed for close to two years now. My biggest position is in AMD, for the reasons I listed."

It's more discretionary than NVDA.  \n\nNVDA is just too expensive, in my opinion because of the metaverse hype, but we are seeing the valuations contract. Maybe you get it at 40 p/e soon."

     "Based on what I\u2019ve read, you have never invested into a solid company before. Pot stocks and gaming stocks should not be invested in with the thought of long term growth. You can try and get rich quick and be broke for life, or get rich over a long period of time and be much better off. I recommend when you buy stocks, you look at the P/E ratio. It\u2019s price of the stock divided by earnings per share. It gives you a much better indication weather a stock is over valued or not. Don\u2019t look at stock price or % growth, look at the P/E ratio. Right now apple is at 30. The S&P average P/E is like 15. Higher P/E the more investors expect the stock to grow. Hold apple for 10 years and undoubtedly it will be worth more than it is today (not a financial advisor). Apple is a solid buy, and it will continue to grow undoubtedly. For reference amazons P/E is in the 80\u2019s and Tesla is in the 600\u2019s. Focus on solid companies like apple that have a competitive advantage and will continue to grow. I\u2019d look into a S&P 500 ETF. It\u2019s the top 500 companies in the US. It automatically filters the bad companies out and the good companies in. Stop looking at share price and % growth, and instead look at P/E of a company that is established and has a history of growth( pot stocks will always rise and fall no matter what)"

And they\u2019ll have Green Day\u2019s and you\u2019ll kick yourself for selling. My advice is hold the stock, maybe trim off some of the profit you made and hold some liquidity in your account for if/when the stock has any sort of big dip. Buying a big dip will quickly recuperate any losses in profits you may have incurred from the dip. And you can only do this if you have liquidity. \n\nAAPL is a great stock with consistent growth.

In my opinion, these statements are quite detached from reality and is a display of lack of understanding of semiconductor and technology. Here's why:\\n\\n1. It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team: Apple started using their in-house designed ARM-based architecture with the iPhone 4S, which was released in 2011. They should be working on the architecture at least 2 years prior to that, which means it takes Apple more than 10 years to be able to build the M1 series. Almost every generation of Apple's in-house design has a huge efficiency advantage over the standard ARM core, which implies the design team of Apple is far more capable than the team in ARM and Qualcomm. Despite that, it still takes them more than 10 years to accumulate the technical legacy and exper\"",

Device drivers and low level OS code, yeah, but for everything else it\u2019s not hard to port to a different architecture. It\u2019s way way harder to port to a different OS or even graphics library. The real cost is testing cycles and infrastructure, not the code.\n\nLinux already runs well on ARM and Microsoft has windows ARM. In the medium term, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if more server side stuff moves to Linux on ARM. Performance per watt especially considering cooling costs is far superior on ARM and single thread performance isn\u2019t that important. I\u2019m surprised it isn\u2019t the standard already."

     "I don't really disagree, but I think you are overstating things.  So here are my disagreements.\n\n> It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team\n\nAgreed, but I think there are more than a few companies that could do that (or arguably already have).  Samsung, Broadcom, qualcom, or nVidia to name a few.\n\n> It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture\n\nLess time now-a-days than ever before.  Particularly if you are already targeting an existing architecture like ARM.  Apple didn't make a new ARM instruction set.\n\nVery little modern software is written in such a way to make it dependent on the instruction set.\n\n> Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node.\n\nWhile true, the same companies I pointed out earlier ARE already using those advanced nodes from TSMC.  Really, the only difference is they've not chosen to enter the server market.\n\nHowever, that's something that's been changing as of late.  Because of ARM's somewhat natural energy efficiency you are starting to see cloud providers offer ARM based systems.\n\nIt's really only a matter of time for some of these mobile manufacturers to decide they want a large piece of the pie.\n\n> The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains \"only\" roughly 54 billion transistors.\n\nYou can't really point at transistor numbers and draw much meaningful conclusions.  M1 Max is both a CPU + GPU.  Further, it has a rather monstrously sized L2 cache (24MB).  The 5900X has a 4MB L2.  That's not really being inefficient with transistors.\n\nBut even so.. so what?  Transistor count might push up die space requirements which decreases yield, but that's not really terribly impactful on the bottom line."

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again."

     "i started buying AAPL in 2015. This came after realizing a had a trading addiction. I was destroying myself financially by YOLOing before Robinhood made it fashionable. I disabled options trading ( except for put writing/ covered calls ),  and studied both Bogleheads and Buffet. So I have benefited enormously from AAPL - there were a lot of pullbacks during the last 6 years, and sideways trading periods. but I took on the Buffet notion of stocks as owning assets in a company and not as abstract symbols where you focus on the ups and downs of price, but look at the long term.   i held through it all, ignored the 2020 crash and just kept going about my life.. obviously the time since then has accelerated everything greatly.  My apple shares unrealized gains are spectacular. Are we finally \"too toppy\" at 180 and a 3 trillion dollar market cap? Maybe, but i find it hard to pull the trigger. Not just because I still believe in AAPL for the next few years, even if there is a pullback, but also because it feels like selling would be going back to the old me that tried to time the market. Maybe I am foolish but until Berkshire dumps its 40 percent portfolio share of AAPL I might reconsider.. until then maybe it is better to just remind myself that stocks are going to  both down and up but the real question is .. what will it be worth 5 years out?"

Even Microsoft has a higher PE ratio then Apple as well but no one seems to bat an eye on their run up. Apple has had slower growth this year compared to Microsoft and Google so it seems like after consolidation Apple has broke out. \n\nYes, Apple's PE ratio currently is higher than it's been at 31 and growth for the next two years is going to be sluggish but the prospects of Apple's next wave of innovation and the flight for safety is driving this run up. Apple has developed their reputation that everything they throw out on the market turns into gold so it's probably safe to say the new AR glasses which will come out in the next 18 months most likely will be the new hot thing along with a gateway to the metaverse and whatever that entails. Then the Apple car which isn't coming out soon but if it does come out may just revolutionize driving. The apple ecosystem is a titan. Then other aspects like strong stock buyback over the years and a very healthy balance sheet has ensured Apple to be the safest stock.\n\nI think Apple stock will stagnate for the next two years as growth will be somewhat limited in the next two years and YoY comparisons won't look too good but once their next wave of products start to hit in 2023 or so Apple may just add another trillion or so.

This is a major chunk of revenue that is likely going to be greatly diminished before long. Revenue that had the highest profit margin and lowest overhead of any of their revenue generators may be going away. Once more 3rd party app developers understand that they do not have to give apple 30% of in app purchases anymore, your going to see a lot more \"light\" versions of apps show up in the store that are baseline functional, but will require in app purchases directly through their 3rd party sites(bypassing apple and their skimming off the top) to unlock the full featured program. As it stands 70% of in app revenue that apple was taking was mostly from a handful of free to play mobile games(such as EPIC's Fortnight) that can now offer customers the ability to pay for in app purchases directly from the developer, cutting apple out of the purchase. Some will even be willing to incentivize costumers doing so by charging them less to go direct, rather than through apple's portals."

Many have already said many of my points, so two points I didn\u2019t see yet: \n\n-Nokia failed precisely because apple has the ability to innovate better than them. Nokia didn\u2019t have an entire ecosystem of products. They just had phones. They didn\u2019t have services. They didn\u2019t have a whole slew of new things to add to the phone that would increase its capability to work with its other products. They had phones. \n\n-Also not mentioned: home automation. People don\u2019t have to like where apple is with HomeKit now, but last year 20-30 million smart speakers were sold in the US (according to NPR). This is a huge growing sector of which apple is a part, and they keep improving it. Yet another area for future innovation and growth. Apple already has the apple ecosystem going for it. This will only further attract/retain customers that seek to get more out of their already existing apple products while deepening their relationship with apple.\n\nI would generally agree that phones are the biggest thing they have done in the last twenty years. But you\u2019re also failing to see their history of incredible innovation. Just because *you* can\u2019t imagine what they\u2019ll come up with next doesn\u2019t mean they will come up empty handed in the next twenty years."

New Macbook Pros have better performance, longer battery lives, better screens than pretty much any other competitor. Apple is currently fixing a lot of the mistakes they made in the past, regarding the entire Mac lineup. \n\nAnd there's also something about this that people don't seem to grasp. Apple was never a company that would be the first ones to implement new and shiny innovations. It's a company that puts its user in focus: Usability, what its users actually need, what they want to feel like and express, those are factors that define Apple. Theyre not LG, who tried so desperately pushing new, unfinished innovations onto the market and failing every year. \n\nOfc its dangerous to be so reliant on iPhone, but it's not their only market. More dangerous is probably that all their assets are designed by Apple themselves. If just one of their departments (like their processor development or software) slows down, can't keep up, their entire product lineup is affected."

They can always expand on supplementary products around the iPhone/iPad and macs. From full blown services like Apple TV+ to little things like official cases for their devices.\n\nFundamentally their brand power is insane, it doesn't really matter what they sell, people will buy it, because it's high quality, and they have that premium reputation now. They have all the money in the world to innovate, and I'm sure behind the scenes they are, it doesn't they all have to come to market though. For me they don't need anything radical, they can keep doing business as they are, and pump out high quality products and services, and it will sell well.\n\nTheir latest big innovation was only recently, the M1 chip. It's insane that Apple now produces their own processor, and it's blowing everyone away."

     "I\u2019m long in AAPL. Only about 200 shares, average $70.\n\nI see the company as still very innovative - maybe not to the market, but self innovation.\n\nThe iPhone has plateaued because it\u2019s almost 15 years old so there\u2019s only so much you can do. Just like desktop computers and then laptops. And tablets. People only need them for so many features, so naturally there will come a point where all they can do is improve specs and have fewer features to add.\n\nThey\u2019ve seen that themselves, hence the huge shift to services - AppleCare insurance, Apple Music and all the new features of that (spatial audio and lossless), Apple TV is a big one (although still in its infancy), Cloud storage. On and on the list can go.\n\nNokia was pretty much only known for making phones. No laptops. No television.  No games console. Nothing. It\u2019s inevitable they\u2019d crash if something bigger and better came along in their one singular category. And even then, they didn\u2019t really try to keep up. They attempted a smart phone a bit, but IIRC they put Microsoft OS on it\u2026 so you can barely call that an attempt haha.\n\nAirPods was probably Apple\u2019s last new product category and definitely one that took the world by storm. Apple Watch just before that.\n\nI have no doubts they\u2019ll be able to do it again, but those new categories are maybe 1-2 per decade. And we know from strong rumours they\u2019re working on AR glasses which the newer iPhones and iPad Pros are helping gather data for. Plus Apple Car as well. The car no doubt will be a huge one. AR glasses remains to be seen, but will become one of those things like AirPods where people laugh at first, then a year later they\u2019ve bought some anyway.\n\nFor now they can coast on their reputation and quality to get by comfortably until they\u2019re ready to reveal something to the world."

     "So as you read through these responses you probably noticed that there is no consensus and many of the picks are highly risky.\n\nThe truth is this: These techs are amazing and world changing however that doesnt mean any particular company will make money from them. This is why there is no consensus.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you 1st look at company fundamentals and then match that up with the techs you are fishing for. For instance, almost anyone can make an app like ChatGPT but has anyone made a profit from any AI?\n\nThe answer is yes, there are companies who profitably use AI where AI is critical to their functionality. The behemoth is Amazon which uses AI in very practical ways from robotics in their logistical infrastructure, to controlling their cashier free grocery stores. They use AI to drive practical brick and mortar operations. Another would be anyone who has a profitable search engine such as Google and MSFT and you can make an argument for FB/META. For me the long term winner is the brick and mortar applications done by Amazon because those are not dependent on a fad that may or may not be around tomorrow. Practicality is important to business profit. There are other companies that implement AI but id say to limit to profitable companies because ultimately, the core of these technologies is not patentable so no one has any major advantage so I would look for real profitability rather than unicorns.\n\nIn the green energy space, I like green utilities but the problem with all utilities is debt and this rising interest environment. If not for the immense debt, they are long term winners because they make energy for less than traditional companies including nuclear. But alas im not aware of any that dont have immense interest rate risk.\n\nWhich brings me to the two companies I do like in green energy, and they are ENPH and SEDG. Basically companies that make inverters and offer a software platform to manage it. The key here is the platform or software environment. Think of it as an operating system that once it becomes popular, drives even more sales because it is familiar to the workers who build and install these systems.\n\nIn 3D printing, I would once again, look at who uses it in a practical manner rather than who sells the printers or materials. For example, Hasbro uses the tech to make toys. I wouldnt buy them because the toy business sort of sucks, but the point here is this tech makes sense to them. Others to look at are big manufacturers in general. Guys like Ford, Boeing, and even Nike. All of them have increasingly shifted some things to 3d printers but unfortunately some have been doing it for a very long time so its not like you are getting in on the ground floor. Ford for example, has been using 3d printing since the 80s..."

Mostly so to create an AI that can understand the user\u2019s surroundings and can be used in both AR glasses and autonomous vehicles. Tim Cook himself has mentioned they see this as their hardest problem, but one they intent to solve. Other than that AAPL in general is a great stock to own.\n\nW.r.t. green energy I\u2019d recommend Fluence (FLNC), which is a global leader in utility battery energy storage. The simple thesis being that the world needs lots of energy storage to fully transition to intermittent renewable energy sources. They also offer some pretty advanced autobidding AI software, so they can be considered both a green energy and AI play."

But I'm sticking with it because I'm already in the green since I bought post-dividend cut and perhaps they will surprise us with something strategically special. If not, I'll just keep collecting the half-decent divvy and hope for slow gains.\n\nBrookfield has a narrow but solid strategy. They have a decent asset growth plan and have access to relatively cheap capital through Brookfield parent. They know how to manage merchant power assets and with the knowledge they are building on the renewable side, I think they will provide decent long term returns (but no crazy beta) over other merchant generators.\n\nI'm also in MSFT and AMZN but don't have any special insights/theses that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere."

I look at something like NVDA where an EOM 350C is $60 as a good example of this. Seems like free money to me.\n\nCash secured puts, which are more or less the inverse of a covered call, could also be worth looking into for you. They require some more meticulous planning as you really need to be comfortable with the entry price should you get exercised but if you're using the amount of cash required to make strategies like this worthwhile there is no excuse for not doing your homework."

I then got comfortable and started being a buy and hold investor for certain companies. I learned a lot by taking losses along the way but eventually three years ago I started options trading. I again took losses trading options until I refined my strategy and now this year I\u2019m up 14.6% YTD (vs 8.3 for SPY). I learned from every loss and I\u2019m still learning. I now mostly short bull put spreads, sell covered calls and open short strangles and iron condors on SPX with short legs delta 16 with 37 DTE. I\u2019ve now learned to reduce risk and volatility and all the same time generating an exceptional return but this took over 13 years of sweat and tears and losses. And I\u2019m still hopeful and know that to be really successful I need to show that I can beat the index over the long run and that this isn\u2019t a fluke. \n\nThroughout my time investing I\u2019ve learned that you must be open to new ideas. I was a big fan of indexing and buy and hold and I think for most people this works. But I\u2019m passionate about math and trading and have found buy and hold and indexing for me actually is more volatile than doing what I do now which is shorting options."

Trading is 10% learning the technical analysis/strategy and 90% mindset. That\u2019s why back testing doesn\u2019t work. You have no emotions involved. It takes minimum 2 years to learn how to just be profitable because it takes that long to adjust your mindset.  If you are wondering what the hell is a trading mindset then you are really really really not ready. The way a trader thinks is completely different from everyday logic. That\u2019s why it takes a long time because you\u2019re training your brain to think in away that it has never think before. Come to r/realdaytrading if you are serious about learning how to trade. \n\nLastly, I already know that you won\u2019t listen and will trade with real money soon anyways. You will lose and either quit or start over and learn the correct way. Or worst you will start to win and will think you figured it out. It\u2019s so easy. What the heck are all these people talking about. Then one day you will lose it all. Because it was all luck and you have built up really bad trading habits when you made the money in the first place. And now it\u2019s even harder to learn the right way.

Now I own 4 times the shares and don\u2019t plan to sell for another 5-10 years.\n\nAround that time Apple was mis-categorized as a hardware and a cyclical company. There was an analyst who recommended a short sell at 95! He, like many others felt that iPhone sales had peaked and Apple's best days were behind it. I bought Apple believing that it should be valued much higher than good consumer staples with little or no growth like Coke and P&G -- at above 20 times earnings; Instead, Apple was  getting sold at 10 to 12 times after having grown revenues 15 fold in the last 10 years! I believed that the future growth would come from services and wearables.\n\nIt took a Warren Buffett to get Apple to its rightful multiple and valuation\u2026\u2026I don\u2019t expect Apple to fall below 25X earnings in the future. It\u2019s in the sweet spot of being a stalwart, consumer staple with growth from at least two segments \u2013 services and wearables.\n\nTo me, Apple\u2019s greatest strength is its integration of hardware and software, it\u2019s really a system on chips from start to finish \u2013 completely integrated and the best product in all its categories, which allows it to increase prices and have the best margins in the industry, and throw up gobs of cash!\n\nApple\u2019s best days are ahead of it."

I was admittedly a bit of a fanboy but I believed in them, what they were doing, where they were going. There was nothing I could do but put my money where my mouth was and buy a few shares with money I'd saved up. A full 10% of the money I had to spend went to the brokerage fees, ouch. But I held, and now I'm selling some off just because it's the majority of my portfolio and I ought to diversify a bit (I have other investments, it has just overtaken them all). Similar deal with Tesla a while back. I blocked Seeking Alpha because all the headlines I was getting were \"Tesla is overvalued\", \"Here comes the next Tesla killer\", etc, it was like they were out to get them. I didn't own any shares (felt like I missed the boat), but when I saw a headline that said \"Tesla at lowest price in 3 years\", I couldn't pass it up. It's now worth like 10x and I'm kicking myself for not buying more (I know, you can't). Point is, I believed in them and what they were doing, and the headlines were all downers, and I plan to hold for years to come. Trading is fun but sometimes you just gotta hold."

     "The fortitude to hold thru highs and lows when you are convinced of a company value deserves some praise.\n\nBut seems you are discounting the fact you also got lucky, both with timing and ticket choice. Suggesting that valutation doesn\u2019t matter is wrong, and being the first to perfect a product is no guarantee of continued successs.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about valutation and timing:\n\nYou held Apple during a great bull market, when many lots of companies did great.\nWhat if you bought tech at the height of the .com bubble? It may have taken ten years to recover your investment, and many stocks would still be at a loss after 20.\nSo you want to avoid buying at such a peak. How to do it? That crash came following crazy valutations. Valutations do matter a lot, especially for a long term investor.\n\nBuffett always looks to buy at a discount on fair value, to have a margin of safety. A company can be both an amazing business and a terrible investment, if you pay too much.\nThe market has been defined a voting machine on the short term and a weighting one on the long. That\u2019s why if you plan to hold long term you should be especially concerned about value.\nHolding long doesn\u2019t justify paying too much, it\u2019s the opposite. You can pay too much if you are holding short term and taking advantage of a trend.\nOverpaying to hold long term, you are betting that the market will stay irrational until your company eventually grows into its inflated price. Success depends on two conditions both being true, adding to risk.\n\nWhich brings to stock choice. Optimism on the long term future of a business is often misplaced.\n\nCisco in the 2000s was considered a guaranteed winner of the internet revolution. Network equipment, powering the internet! It looked like Tesla does today, at the top of a new and exciting world change.\n21 years later, Cisco\u2019s price is still down roughy a third from its peak. History is full of such falls from grace. Beware of survivor bias.\n\n>\tThe company to perfect a product first and build a following is tough to over throw, if they stay innovative\n\nSuch a big and unguaranteed IF, given as an aside, feels like intellectual cheating. How can you be sure that they will remain innovative in the right ways (and execute well, as importantly)? It\u2019s a huge question mark.\nYou point to Apple, I point to the leaders before it, Nokia and Blackberry. Who would have guessed at their peak that they would have \u201cstopped to innovate\u201d?\n\nLook at your new picks, three out of four you mentioned are memes.\nPeloton for example, it isn\u2019t comparable to Apple. There is an element of prestige in owning a brand phone or car, because they are items you use in public. Not so much an indoor bike.\nWhat stops anyone else to offer a comparable product at better price? Nothing.\nYou think they will succeed long term because of brand loyalty? Here is a funny scenario: what happens if Apple starts selling an exercise bike, integrated with FaceTime and updated social connectivity for iPhone users? Where will the \u201ccool\u201d Peloton users go?\nWhat happens when people go back to the gym? Peloton targets wealthy users who can afford top gyms with a pleasant ambience, which offer a superior experience to home training. Being close to lots of real people working hard has a pumping effect in itself, it\u2019s more fun and gets the adrenaline flowing, you feed on each other\u2019s energy."

     "Agreed.  New investors don't get this.\n\nI think looking at ones stocks to much can be partly the issue.  Makes person act emotionally -- which surprising most investors are.\n\nNot that is should make a difference, but dollar amount and not a percentage also makes people more jumpy.  Example:  5% of 1,000.  vs. a 5% move on 1,000,000 :)  Logical it should not make difference to a person, but physiologically it a whole different story.\n\nNews and sentiment drives people choices.  I also think the large fish purposely love to generate volatility and for that exact reason.   They feed of the small \"insecure\" fish, people think stop losses are \"good\", when in realty those can murder you if set them to tightly.  I tend to not use them.  Netflix when they dropped heavily when they wanted to rename and spin off DVD way back, that crap was nuts ... wild & \"suspicious\" ride that was.  But its a good example of the physiological ride, the correct thing would have been to add 2/3 on the way down, then another 1/3 where one guess the bottom was.  But the realty was the brave held  for dear life (not daring to buy a single addition point), and the majority just dumped out of panic and never bough back.   Then after it rocked the \"brave\" that had held and never added when seeing 40% profit sold their positions (after that ride, 40% looks pretty great) .. and only the very, very rare trader help and did the 2/3, 1/3 adding to their positions ... and again the hedgies make their millions/billion and murder the small fish.  It has been this way since black Friday.  Nothing new.\n\nSo yea, to hold a stock it really ... really hard IMO and not as easy as people think.  They look at chart history and think it was an \"easy\" ride ... when it never is.\n\nI favor larger cap companies with good track records, but even large companies can go belly up ... and I think infinitely holding a stock can be dangerous too.  The good think about large can is they much harder for hedgies to generate artificial volatility.\n\nAt the end of the day, investing is a physiological game mostly with yourself IMO ... with no easy answers.\n\nI have been trading on and off since before .com crash, 9/11 ... that crap was nuts.  Then came house market crash and the more resent Armageddon \"we all gonna die\" of covid crap.  Even Buffet made a statement that \"now he had seen it all\", yet that man had allot of cash on hand when it happened and they added allot of positions after the tanking.\n\nTrading is really not for the faint at heart.\n\nI really don't have any good advice to give."

Although they are cheaper than before i wouldnt compare to previous levels as it wouldnt mean much.\n\n I prefer to pick my investment without using as little assumptions as possible: I picked META at $92 (250B cap at the time, 180B assets,  $105b tangible, 60B cash and marketable securities, strong FCF on a TTM, strong rev and margins close to peak) but im getting ready to sell incase things go south since things seem to be going to well for my liking.

     "I have a great degree of respect for Netflix as a tech company because they have been a legitimate innovator in terms of building a very intelligent SoA system, tons of microservices, their architecture and blogs are very fascinating reads to see how a world class organization handles it's data and systems. They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.\n\nHowever today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.\n\nMiddle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.\n\nNetflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. \n\nI think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience. A true event that they have to capture at the designated time because otherwise they feel left out when their peers are talking about it."

And content costs will be bid up by their much richer competitors.  \n\nThey hit customer saturation several years ago, and hid it with their silly metrics.  They hit price saturation at covid re-opening.  So they can't grow subs, and they can't charge them more... but they have to.  Their funky and false way of claiming \"profitability\" won't hold up to tougher scrutiny.\n\nThey're doing their usual shell game of pretending there's growth with the shiny object of ad-tier.  But you don't make an ad-service that requires customers to sign up and pay.  That's why they had to refund all their advertisers.  And the ad-tier will cannibalize their existing subs/pricing anyway."

     ">It appears to be a vicious circle for all content providers.\n\nIt's not a vicious cycle, it's theoretically a virtuous cycle when done correctly. In fact, it is the bedrock of Netflix's business model. [Check out Netflix's flywheel](https://jenvandermeer.org/2020/06/09/netflix-business-model-teardown/)\n\nYou cannot compare Google and Netflix. They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)\n\nAlso, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).\n\nTheir gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. \n\nTLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't. Very different companies."

Momentum for building out the PS5 ecosystem is growing, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said on a call after the earnings Thursday, waving off concerns about a demand lull for the two-year-old console.\\n\\nSony also hiked its operating profit forecast to 1.18 trillion ($9.2 billion) from 1.16 trillion. The key games division, aided by the tailwind of favorable exchange rates, nudged expectations higher. Sony said it now sees slightly lower revenue for the year than previously.\\n\\nGiven the current climate where demand is deteriorating around the world, its amazing that Sonys earnings are in line with expectations, said Morningsta'",

     "I don't think Microsoft really cares as much as Sony to be honest. I mean they obviously want to make more money from Xbox, but like, gaming is just a tad under 50% of Sony's revenue, whereas it's like 10% of Microsoft's revenue. Microsoft has far greater ambitions. Plus as others have pointed out, the Xbox really is just a segue device into getting a proper PC, or a PC-lite way of gaming for Microsoft's ecosystem. Sony has no equivalent whatsoever.\n\nI am more than thrilled for Sony to be excelling in the console gaming space, but it's not really an apples to apples comparison against Microsoft."

     "Honestly, I don't think Apple's privacy change is a huge headwind, it's just a temporary set back so long as they can continue to grow. The problem I have is will they continue to grow? I get that DAU is likely down this quarter because of the pandemic, but if their active user growth is stalling or dropping that's going to put significant pressure on their growth going forward. In previous years there seemed to be to a lot of competition in the social media space and people have been concerned about user growth for a while, but competition really seems to have picked up in recent years and it's to the point now where a lot of people I know don't use any FB products to connect with friends and family anymore, especially among younger demographics.\n\nIf FB reports a decline in DAU for another quarter or two, they're done imo. The stock isn't going to recover from that and there isn't any obvious reason to expect DAU trends to change significantly in the near future. At best your looking at stagnating growth of their core products, and the metaverse at this point is just a moonshot which I'm personally not convinced of.\n\nWho knows with FB though... It's not like this is the first time people have worried about FB's user growth. I also think the stock is very cheap right now and the market is massively overreacting with a 20% drop. I don't think it's a bad buy, but I also don't think the long-term future is that bright for them."

Nothing crazy, but they are still growing like 7%ish a year. \n\nYou'll notice another import factor, the number in 2020. \n\nDuring the pandemic, the supply chain wrecked the new car market. This has a ripple effect. It means people will continue to hold onto used cars, but also this impacts the car rental market. Since they were holding onto used cars for longer, there as more demand for autoparts. \n\nThis is because of the way warranties work on cars. You usually get 3 years or X amount of miles for full coverage. So it's in the advantage of rental car companies to buy new and sell used."

So you get at most 68% of the shares from your grant.\n2.\tThe vested shares are taxed as ordinary income, and that is levied on the day's value of the shares at vesting time, not their original grant value. So you are essentially paying ordinary income tax on unrealized capital gains.\n3.\tThis sucks because companies now grant you a dollar amount of shares, not a number of shares.  And they pick the price for those shares. So in a growing economy, your yearly grant means fewer and fewer shares that are taxed more.\n4.\tOn top of this, you have to hold on to those shares for a year to get long-term capital gain status.\n\nGive me options any day.

Same thing applies to buy backs - they're not universally good. As a shareholder you shouldn't want a company like GOOG blindly buying back a load of it's stock because as an innovative tech company they should have better use of that capital. I actually think for fast growing tech companies SBC is a great way to secure talent and honestly I think employees having the option to be paid in stock is something more companies should practise anyway.\n\nBut whatever your thoughts are on SBC to put this in perspective over the last 10 years GOOG has grown their top and bottom line by more than 550%. 12.8% dilution over that period is so insignificant that it would be within the margin of error of any DCF model."

     "UNH\nUnited Health is a steady rocket ship. Check out the chart since about 2008. It\u2019s not a sexy stock but it\u2019s a true money maker especially if you want a long term position.  Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here\u2019s why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically \u201cprice fixing\u201d. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.\nHow do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that\u2019s not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we\u2019re forced into annual increases no matter what.\nThe health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences\u2026 low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. \nJust food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation\u2026 lol"

     "There is also a report that Apple shipped 5-10% more iPhones than expected last quarter, so the truth is somewhere between, most likely.   Though everyone is expecting a lousy quarter and it probably will be, any hint of getting past this by AAPL will send the stock up quite  bit very quickly. Plus, unless you believe Putin will wage war forever even without ammo or soldiers left, and the Fed will continue raising rates long after the economy has slowed down,  this is the time to BUY.  Everything except cryptos or TSLA, the latter because of its ultra high PE which is not justified.\n\nTo me, the real golden goose is AAPL. My Colombian girlfriend's iphone died yesterday and boy did she panic. \"I spend my whole life on that phone, I run my business on that phone, I need a new one now, please send $800\". Then, as I queried her about fixing her old iPhone she ignored me and just bought a new one on credit for the asking price. She couldn't bear to be without it even for a few hours. Therefore, multiple her by a billion and contemplate the reality of today's world.\r  \n\r  \nBesides basic food and survival, the iPhone is the top priority. I have seen homeless people with iPhones. In 2008, at the pits of that crash, I had 250,000 cash and decided to go all in when no one was buying stocks. I had to pick a stock though. I did the same mental math about \"what is the last thing young people will give up even if there is a depression?\" I decided it was the iPhone. I bought AAPl at $15 a share and accumuated more on steep selloffs and now have 55,000 shares. Warren Buffett also added to AAPL's value when he went heavily in, his first tech stock ever. So, in the time period when IO was growing my wealth with AAPL, through ups and downs, gold has been all over the place, cryptos were born, peaked during the covid lockdowns then crashed and now seem likely to die and disappear. and ten years from now if I dont sell any, my AAPL shares will probably be worth around 15 million dollars. So ,let this be a lesson. Want longterm stability and wealth growth? Invest in AAPL, and right now at $139, it is a bargain. No real risk at all."

But Google put up three times the growth rate!!\n\nPlus Google just has a massive runway to work with to keep it going.\n\nPeople forget that Google is 1/2 the age of Apple and Microsoft.\n\nIt is mind blowing that Google is now a $250 billion dollar business and last quarter grew at over 30% !!!\n\nSo much for the law of large numbers.\n\nThe big difference is that these companies have a ton of different avenues to find growth when they need it.   Google for example still gives away a lot of stuff.   Look at Android.  Over a billion devices activated each year and Google does not charge a cent.  Plus there is basically no competition on the lower and mid range as Apple is priced far higher.\n\nSo Google could add a nominal Android license fee and generate billions in new profits.  There would be almost zero additional expense.  So just charging $10 license would not change sales and would add $10 billion of new profits for Google.    Or Google could end the blocking of ads on YouTube if they wanted to.  YouTube TV you can NOT block ads.   So Google could kill the ad blockers if they wanted to with YT.  There is plenty of other examples with the three."

I have two kids under 20 and no one their age uses facebook at all. They do use Google laptops, a few Iphones, Ipads, Macbook Airs, and a couple of PC's.

That\u2019s all stock is is claims in future cash flows. So Apple and Microsoft are valued right now at a very low discount rate (low risk) of future cash flows. Which is actually the most risky scenario possible. If I look at FB trading at 18x this whats cash flows there is MUCH less risk because what is my downside? 25%? But if I buy Apple it\u2019s trading at 30x this year\u2019s earnings. I see that as way more risky."

If you think about it we spend a lot\nof time looking down into our phones, which is not really natural or even good in most situations. Picking the right stocks and investments in the area is another story. I suppose infrastructure companies with more verticals like Nvidia, Unity, Apple etc is more safe. Virtual Reality to me seems more like an enhancement for gaming, but who knows. I really like the new PlayStation VR set. Hated Horizon World. Virtual Worlds is interesting, thinking Roblox and the way the get brands like Nike and Gucci to invest in their platform, and support them in generating revenue and awareness. It is a nice supplement to traditional online marketing reaching a younger demographic."

They cut their losses instead of wasting time and money on that product. A good example is how people on this forum think Google Cloud is going to get killed off in the near future (lol). It\u2019s already bringing in $25B revenue annually. \n\nGoogle has 90% of the search market which gives them the best access to user data, along with phenomenal financials that allow them to dump billions of R&D into AI & ML research. 80% of their search money comes from 1st party tracking. Unless world governments suddenly decide that Google can\u2019t hold user data and legislate their profitability away - the company will continue to do well. \n\nCloud Computing TAM is projected to be $1.4T by 2030. Google has the talent and resources to maintain 3rd place. Even if they only scalp 10% of market share. That\u2019s still $140B revenue, and 30% net margins mean $40B in profit. Search is already bringing in over $40B so Google is realistically looking at $80-100B+ profit by the end of the decade. Oh and YouTube TV is making successful moves in the cable space. They just landed NFL Sunday Ticket! And the stock is $1.1T? Easy buy. \n\nGoogle has grown revenue 20%+ on an annualized basis every year except for this year and the early 2010s. Search isn\u2019t going away (unless chatGPT can be developed better in terms of functionality and accuracy). And Cloud + YouTube are very profitable segments.

In some ways Google is like the startup that never stopped growing. Google has innovated, the fact that Chrome became so successful is a testament. I also think the chrome cast is a solid device with some performance related issues at times. \n\nChatGPT is a legitimate competitor to Google if it ever becomes a real commercial product. Google has to innovate its core service with search to really have a future. Google is very much ingrained in the world though. There is no serious competitor to Google Maps. I also think things like Google\u2019s cloud based Office Suite competitor are really good. Both Google Sheets and Docs are just so much better than any competitor it\u2019s not even funny.\n\nGmail is fine too. At worst Google this decade becomes like Microsoft in the 00s."

But they weren't innovative in the sense that they came up with completely new products nobody could imagine, but versions of products that blew people away over time. Like Google vs Yahoo. Android vs iOS and Windows Mobile. Chrome vs Internet Explorer and Firefox.\n\nSo really, they did great on execution and reimagining of existing things. And Eric Schmidt was a good balance where he brought enough pressure for the ideas to have some sort of payoff horizon and pressure to finish projects that otherwise would be canceled.\n\nOnce Eric left and the two founders took a backseat, the founders got obsessed with not being disrupted and spending cash to find the next big thing. They incentiized the the creation of project after project regardless of whether or not they were successful, and didn't pressure anyone to succeed at a project to get compensated, so they ended up funding half-baked ideas, conflicting products like 19 different messenger apps, and a self driving program that is literally impossible to scale without driver data like Tesla.\n\nThe example I'd use is California or Russia or any government with incredible natural resources. You'd think these governments would just build off these incredible resources to become amazing paradises, but the more abundant the resources, the more likely it is that the government is corrupt or incompetent. Singapore only exists because it has an amazingly competent government; it basically has no resources."

The list goes on.\n\n  \nOverall, I'd say the stock is an extremely strong purchase; low P/E compared to competitors, solid low-risk business with a strong moat and potential to grow even further. If only they offered dividends...\n\n  \nAlthough even then, the fact that they don't shows confidence that they can further increase their market cap without doing so."

Second gen introduced GPS, turn-by-turn navigation, and the app store. Third gen introduced multitasking, FaceTime and the front-facing camera. That incredible pace of innovation ultimately translated into growth, both in market share and in value.\n\nFlash forward to 2020 and what did we get? A slightly higher resolution display that nobody but phone nerds will ever notice, and new color options. It's not their fault, it's just that smartphones are boring now - even an entry-level Huawei phone satisfies all of the needs of the average consumer and more.\n\nThis trend is playing out across all of Apple's products. Think about the differences between Panther and Leopard, versus the differences between Catalina and Big Sur.\n\nI don't expect Apple to shrink any time soon (it would take a lot to dislodge the average Apple consumer from that ecosystem) but I do think that they are going to stop growing. Ripe markets like renewable tech, AI, and electric cars have far more room for innovation and growth than venerable markets like smartphones and operating systems."

An inflation level of 4% would be a huge improvement form last year's levels but still far from enough for the Fed."

     "We're drawing a lot of comparisons between this downturn and the 1970s. Presumably because that's the most recent recession caused by extreme inflation, as well as being one of the worst inflationary periods in our history.\n\nBut it's much easier to find comparisons between now and the 1949 recession. It was basically a supply run brought on a by a variety of factors but mostly due to soldiers returning home from war and starting families and finding new jobs. There was a huge jump in home prices and demand for things like ovens and other goods shot through the roof.\n\nWe're almost in the opposite side of the same coin - supply dropped off a cliff due to covid and therefore demand shot through the roof.\n\nObviously there are other factors to take into account but during that time but there are way more similarities to 1949 than 1970s oil crisis, in my opinion. That recession lasted for a year and unemployment peaked at 7.1%. It was one of the mildest recessions the US has had.\n\nhttps://recession.tips/the-recession-of-1949/\n\nhttps://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/usa/history/recession-of-1949.htm"

I think they are saying if a third party app collects data on you, which you specifically allowed when you installed the app, Apple might use that data too. An example is when you use a third party exercise app and Apple updates your stats in their health app. Or Apple suggest other exercise apps in the store. But I don\u2019t see any specific right for a third party app to \u201cmisuse\u201d your data - whatever that means.\n\nPersonally I\u2019ve been moving towards using fewer 3rd party apps in general and using Apple\u2019s stuff instead (Maps, Safari, Fitness+, etc) which is exactly what Apple was hoping everyone would do.

     "Yes Google pays Apple 15 billion or so a year for the right to be their main search engine. Tim Cook has qualms about that and it sickens him a little but Google is the best in many ways plus their cash is not something to sneeze at so he did it for the good of the company and platform.  The #1 search query on Bing is \"Google\".  People know Google tracks and mines them but they offer so much for free that people don't mind so much.\n\nFacebook is a different animal. for one thing it let Putin and Trumpsters use 10 millon fake lying trolls in 2016 to weaponize and rig our election, a surprise attack for which Facebook was very well paid.  Olus since those trolls and fake news sites generated so much user activity they could brag on user numbers and activity to raise ad costs and the stock price.\n\nSince the GOP could not admit the 2016 election was rigged they stayed mum on the troll issue until facebook started removing the worst of the Russian disinformation trolls and then they complained FB was censoring \"conservative voices\", really Russian fascist liars, to which Zuckerberg explained that he is jewish and disagrees with Nazis but he had to let them keep lying.  Finally Zuck did the right thing and booted Trump but too little too late. Now the GOP is controlled by Russian fascism and our entire democracy is in grave danger.\n\nFast forward to this last two months when Zuck sees Facebook user activity falling fast and regulatory brick wall ahead and changes the company name and focus to Meta-verse which doesn't even exist yet and which may never take off, or if it does it may take off on other platforms instead, or a thousand different ones.  \n\nAll things considered, I would avoid FB stock for all kinds of reasons including the fact that it may still be 200% overvalued with Instagram as the only real jewel left in its crown. and how long will that last?  I am already sick of obnoxious Instagram influencers trying to make people envious of their perfect lifestyles."

I am basically locked into the apple cloud and it will take a lot to reconsider changing my phone. When apple gets into EV (which they will) they will have tons of growth. APPL has enough cash to do anything and keep up with the latest technology.\n\nWith that being said, apple is not the only stock I own but will continue to add to my position.\n\n$SPY is a great ETF that I will also slowly add to my position over time. \n\nLike you said you make around 70K a year, so IMO id keep ur apple and continue to add S&P ETF when you can.\n\nhopefully that helps! \n\nAlso always do ur own research, this is my opoinion and I could be completely wrong ahah."

     "Everyone is saying Apple is safe but nobody says why or for how long. I'm gonna give you some advice as a tech enthusiast and not as an investor.\n\nLook, hold on to them, but don't believe Apple is invincible. My recommendation would be to at least hold until they announce the \"Apple Car\", maybe sell some or most of your stocks right when the hype gets at its highest, because that car might not be as good as people is expecting it to be, or it might be ahead of its time and just not sell well because of that. It is a risky move from them, and Apple products have failed many times. Yeah, they have mostly done great because they have good products, but everything sits around the iPhone, and the smartphone industry is starting to evolve, same goes for the tech industry, moving towards AI and ML, which Apple is not very good at, and probably will never be as good as the competition just because of their focus on \"privacy\" (mostly BS to justify being behind everyone else in this regard).\n\nLook, if the smartphone industry evolves too much and Apple is not the one to lead that change (they are not doing it right now), things might get hard for them. And even if it does not evolve enough and stays mostly the same (form factor-wise), smartphones are getting very competitive right now, and Apple's market share can start decreasing significantly.\n\nApple knows this, that's why they are doing AirPods, Apple TV, and all those subscription services, because they know their stake at the smartphone game is increasingly at risk. And if the iPhone starts going down, everything else will go down with it. That's Apple's biggest issue.\n\nNo, I don't think they will go down deep, I'm not saying that. But I think Apple's days as the lead in tech are not gonna last as long as people might think. They will stay safe, but if you are thinking about it long term, start questioning yourself... who could and most likely would take Apple's place in the coming years?\n\nI would take a look at Google instead, they are an even safer bet IMO, they are doing great in AI, ML, self-driving and many more long term shots that actually matter. They are a very diversified portfolio themselves, since they do so many things, if one fails, they still have many bets on other stuff just as promising, they are great investors when it comes to tech. Their main business, ads, is something that will only get bigger as ecommerce becomes more important and overtakes physical stores and more small businesses start using it. They know tech, they know the internet, and they are very good and have a lot of experience working on long term shots that succeed.\n\nAs simple as knowing this: they have the data, valuable enough as it is right now, but they are also building the most powerful tech to make use of that data in ways that we could not even imagine."

The general advice for beginners and the average joe is to go with broad index funds, like vt or vti. S&p500 fund is fine too,  although then you focus just on the largest companies in one region. \n\nYou could keep a small part of your portfolio in individual stocks as a hobby. When you get some more exp, yoo could focus more on individual stocks.\n\nHope this helps. You are already ahead of the curve, good job :). Good luck."

There has been significant increase in deposit outflow in Feb 2023, and bank's own borrowings (bank liabilities) has steadily increased in the past 6 months. This is not a good look. Forget about hiking interest rates, staying the same for \"high and longer\" will continue to cause massive deposit outflow from banks. You are at the mercy of an unhinged Fed if you own bank stocks. The Fed's actions for the past 2 months were wrong and excessive. J Pow's most recent testimony is highly destabilizing. Insiders within the financial elites knew this, yet just today so many \"don't worry about it\" and \"no contagion\" articles were being mass produced. Caveat emptor!"

Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say (note I was in college during the great financial crisis):\n\n1. Start investing excess capital as soon as you can. Compounding is insane and having more money opens up other opportunities to juice your gains (ie selling covered calls for extra, low-risk premium)\n\n2. Whenever you feel like the world is going to end, that\u2019s probably when you should buy. I was worried about markets \u201cnot making sense\u201d in 2012 as I was entering the workforce. I missed out on some nice gains if I had just bought $SPY. Thankfully, I learned my lesson and bought hard during COVID\u2019s initial market crash, which has paid off very well. \n\n3. Put most of your money into index funds, but also allocate some % of your net worth towards fun. Yeah, if you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019ll suck. But you also miss out on opportunity by taking no risk. Plus, you can always write off the losses, so the loss isn\u2019t as bad as it looks on paper. \n\n4. The markets can be irrational for years, but you have to stick to your principles. When people say \u201cvaluation doesn\u2019t matter\u201d, that\u2019s when a top is likely in."

IMO AVGO is a pretty stable long term play however with picking any individual stock you run the risk of something happening with that individual company (INTC for example). \n\nAs others have said, going based purely off of previous performance is a unreliable way to gauge a companies value. I think if there\u2019s something in specific that you like about Broadcom that sets it apart from similar stocks that you see as a driving factor for potential growth then go for it, however I prefer to hold an ETF as I cannot foresee a single Semiconductor stock outperforming the others. Also if it\u2019s that juicy dividend that you\u2019re after then I would recommend SCHD which has Broadcom as its top holding at nearly 5%. You still get a diversified ETF with a 3.5% dividend yield."

Between then and now, Apple would have already done what they threatened to do if they were going to do it.\n\nFrom the price perspective, I'm no pro, but all I've seen is people waiting on the sidelines when they were sure that $380 per share was too high - they'll wait it out and buy some when it goes lower.  Then $450 was too high, they'll wait it out.  By $500 per share those people realized they missed the boat, and now they wish it would drop back down to $550 per share.\n\nMeanwhile, some of us jumped onto the train in the low $300's and just kept buying.  Painful every time, and that pain is completely gone as each year goes by.  If it was so risky now it wouldn't be in the top ten holdings of some of the best performing ETF's out there."

     "Spark is paying [100% imputed dividend](https://investors.sparknz.co.nz/Investor-Centre/?page=Latest-Dividend), I believe that means the dividend you received is already taxed, and if your tax bracket is lower than the imputation tax rate, you may use the credits to offset your other taxes. Sounds complicated, you may want to check on IRD website or ask an accountant friend. \n\nAs for your question, if you use the [compound interest calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm), starting with $50,000 with an interest rate of 6.91%, you'll get $371,124.73 in 30 years. \n\nThe catch is, as others have pointed out, stock is not term deposit and dividend is not interest, it actually deducts from your share price after it is paid. E.g. Share price before payout is $6.00, after a dividend of $0.30 per share is paid out, the share price is automagically adjusted to $5.70 the next day. However, for a stable, healthy company, the share price will always recover and get ready for the next dividend payout, otherwise the company stock will go to zero after few years' dividend payout. \n\nIn short, your $370K in 30 years depends on:\n\n1. Company's stock performance, it can go up, down or even split.\n2. Company's ability to maintain its dividend yield. 6.91% is quite high, higher than most AU/NZ banks! I'm not sure if it's sustainable for the entire 30 years."

     "While your end conclusion might be right, this analysis is unfortunately very flawed.\n\nFirst of all, they have been buying back a lot of shares. I mean tens of billions worth of stock every year. This means that every share outstanding now owns a larger part of the company's revenue and earnings. So while you are analyzing the growth of total revenue, you should be looking at the growth of revenue per share and earnings per share. That is, if you are comparing revenues to Apple's stock price.\n\nSecondly, not every $ sold is valued the same. As an owner of a company you shouldn't focus solely on the top line *(=Revenue)* but rather on what's left for you once everything is paid *(=Net Income/FCF depending on your angle)*. In Apple's case, the revenue stream that is growing the fastest is Services. And because their gross margins on Services is somewhere around 70% while it is around 35% for Products, every Service revenue $ is double as valuable (compared to Products). This is the same phenomenon we are seeing with Amazon and their AWS cloud segment which is highly more profitable than the E-Commerce side.\n\nThere are naturally other factors in play, such as interest rates (*desperate need to find returns on this newly available piles of cash causing multiple expansion*), politics (*Right-to-repair & limiting the power of Tech giants*) but I haven't investigated Apple deeply enough to chip in on those issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple (along with other tech giants) have witnessed huge multiple (P/S, P/E etc.) expansions during the last few years and could very easily be overvalued. However, a simple analysis of a company top line doesn't tell us anything of value."

There's still the 27\" iMac replacement due as well as the top-end Mac Pro. There's a ton of people holding out for these. Self-employed designers and filmmakers, right up to small and mid-sized studios who probably last updated to the 2018 iMac Pro.\n\n2) Going on from that, there's still barely enough stock to meet demand of the newly released 14\" and 16\" MBP which are absolute game-changers for the company. Once supply chain issues are worked out, these will sell like hot cakes.\n\n3) Potential new product categories - though they may not launch this year, any announcement of AR Glasses or a Car will bound to create a ton of buzz around the company and drive interest.\n\n4) A ton of apps are dropping support for iOS 12, including mammoths like WhatsApp, Netflix etc. The iPhone 6 is locked to iOS 12, and a huge amount of people are still rocking those. They're now feeling pressured to update to a new iPhone to continue using their favourite apps.\n\nI think the 2020 surge of sales was definitely beneficial, but mostly for the MBA and MBP and mid-range iPads.

     "Did this guy/girl just say that 2nd biggest company in the world is undervalued????? How do you drop 20K with that little research or understand of valuation. OP the value of a stock is not the price it trades for, Amazon which trades for idk 12x the cost of Apple is valued at 2/3rd of Apple. You did buy an overall good stock just may wanna research some more first. And trust me Apple is highly \u201cregulated\u201d by big money, they will always control the value of Apple hence why it moves so little and on many days controls the S&P 500. I think this lack of understanding may have been why people suggested an ETF. Also the investor who DCA\u2019s their money will be more successful 9/10 times. Also good to train your brain to be happy when the market or asset goes down for a reason that won\u2019t affect the long term, because investors are buyers and buyers want things cheaper - this is a lesson that took me a couple months to wire my brain to. Green Day\u2019s are nice, but I almost never buy on green days. Would you rather buy your coffee for 3$ or buy the same coffee for 5$? That\u2019s the mentality of a long term investor. I wish the best of luck to you OP, you did pick well even though your not diversified. Just please learn more before throwing around what sounds like a lot of money to you. And ALWAYS REMEMBER if it\u2019s a good company and it\u2019s down from where you bought it than in the long run it will eventually surpass where you bought it, which I\u2019m not wizard but I bet Apple will surpass 130 again easily.

     "Just my opinion - \n\nYou can also check on how to create a covered call(with stocks you own) and make money out of premium while holding the stock but the risk is you will lose the share if the stock hits the strike price(some times even if they dont if the buyer exercise the option which I dont think anyone do), in which case you will also land a short term profit.\n\nYou bought for $127. You can create a covered call monthly or weekly for $130 or even $140(the premium will get lower as you increase the strike price). \n\nSo lets say you sell a covered call for $140. You need 100 shares of a company to sell one call option. I dont know how much monthly premium goes for but lets say its at 0.50 so the premium you get would be $50(minus commission fee if there is any) for selling one covered call. At any time the buyer of the call can exercise the option. He would have to exercise at $140 so you will be making $13 per share or another $1300 for the one call option you sold but when they exercise you lose your share."

Thus, whenever any fund needs some money to cover losses elsewhere, they sell off Apple stock.\n\nOn the plus side, Apple has expanded its buyback program to $90B *this year* which means that your shares will be inherently (in 2020, they bought back $50B) Additionally, they are increasing the dividend yield.\n\nIf you want to make more money on AAPL, look at writing (selling) way out of the money covered-calls."

Tesla traded around $442 right after the split then dropped to $370.  Both of these split in August of 2020.   It seems like most companies see some kind of wild price movement around the time of announcing and actually splitting.  Did they announce the split along with kick ass earnings to soften the blow the stock price?   If someone was planning on already starting a position, would it be better to start now or wait till after the split and things settle down?  Just looking for opinions.'",

Let's say 1 in 10, 2 in 10, or 5 in 10 customers are now compelled to choose a competitor; how does this affect Tesla's ability to generate revenue and profit?\n\nYour bear case is very mild. If even 2 in 10 customers are turned away and gross margin drops by 50%, this is starting to become a calamity. There is potentially far more risk that this post assumes.\n\nThere are many anecdotal reports of people embarrassed to drive Tesla's or are no longer interested in buying.

Regardless of where YOU stand on the political landscape, it's about the consumers buying the product and if half of them aren't buying it because they don't support extreme right ideology means you split the market in half. \n\nIMO, TSLA is the worst investment to have, to be holding, to get into. I rather invest in a company that caters to everyone. Also, the clock is ticking. Manufacturers are catching up to EV. TSLA is no longer the only manufacturer anymore and it's hilarious to think otherwise.\n\nIn addition to manufacturers catching up, battery power and infrastructure isn't catching up to speed. I highly doubt the EV shift is happening at the designated time frames they desired it to be here at. It'll prolong ICE and make TSLA harder to invest in."

This breezes over the fact commodities required to produce these cars at a scale of their growth with more competition in their space is going to drastically reduce profit. This is before you factor in the actual cost of ownership for consumers as ESG policies are showing cracks with pressures on grids and consumers being asked not to charge cars. Honestly, I think Elon knows the game is over. Maybe he thought it would go on a little longer but with interest rates high and inflation still a problem I\u2019m very skeptical we will see Teslas or it as an individual company in the long term. I think Elons twitter acquisition was a way to stay relevant and move into a space which isn\u2019t levered on low interest rates. Something which could still help his passion with space exploration. Whether he will cut his losses and sell or it will be forced to close is something I can\u2019t predict. I think recently you\u2019ve seen his interest is not in Tesla anymore."

     "I got in at 48, I got out at 82.  To say the entire market has been a volatile shit show since 3/20 is the understatement of all-time.\n\nI will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.\n\nIf I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.\n\nAs such, TSLA is a riskier derivative of the same pot.  I would be a buyer under $90, but I am out of it at $99.  Unless there is substantial adjustment to the SPX between the time I buy and the time I hit my limit.\n\nThe only stocks I have real determination on right now are auto parts stores AZO and ORLY precisely because of the increasing complexity and interest rate sensitivity of new car sales.  Plus so many people are underwater after overpaying for used cars that they will all end up on the road until they are beyond dead.\n\nEven then, I won't grow my existing positions in my taxable account unless I get assigned on puts.  There's far more money to be made in CSP's right now than actual ownership.  The volatility range is tight.  GEX and VEX have been pretty reliable indicators on setting your prices.  SKEW ticked higher before this upcoming dead week.  And I wouldn't mess with TSLA on options anyway, even though there is a MOUNTAIN of puts right now.  The SPX is volatile enough."

It was hesitant to falling before but now it has some room to fall.  Burry can cash out his shorts in a week or so and make a killing.\n\nBuffet is right long term.  Apple is going to recover.  They have some short term cost increases (chip shortages) and they're getting hit pretty hard in Europe with new laws that'll have some short term cost increases.  And the market for smart phones is going to decrease coming up.  But... they're still going to make money.  Air Pods will still be the world's #1 selling listening devices.  Apple Pay is becoming more and more people and their transactions business is only going to grow.\n\nBurry will sell his shorts in under a month.  Buffet will sell his position in 8 years."

Tesla already has all the hype that Apple products usually get, just look around the Internet, if people talk about how they want to buy an EV in the future they talk about how they want to own a Tesla, especially the 'techie' crowd who are usually the first in line to buy Apple products on their release date.\n\nI just don't see Apple convincing the techie crowd that they have better EV's or EV tech then Tesla does. Think of it this way, if Tesla made their own smartphones, do you really think all that many Apple users would be willing to switch over to it no matter how much more advanced it might be than the iPhone? I don't, because that's the power of branding with these two companies."

The opposite holds true; tech goes down faster and further than the broader market in bad times. The second absolute is that we are in bad times - Jerome Powell is trying to deliberately bring the market down. We can debate on if he should, but there is no debate on if he is trying to do this. \\n\\nThe list of absolutes could continue - but due to us beginning the on average worst month for the stock market - I am betting against Apple and am buying up AAPD. I hold 21 shares of AAPD and will be selling when Apple goes to $141 later this month. We will retest the June lows, and there is a good chance AAPL with slide to $130 again, more money for those of us who invest in AAPD. \\n\\nOther holdings: SQQQ, SDOW.'",

Study the styles of successful investors such as Buffett, Graham, Lynch, Greenblatt, Munger, and so on. Find a strategy that works for you and stick with it. People like to claim it\u2019s impossible to beat the market, but all the people I mentioned above demolished the index over many years. Research shows which strategies work and which don\u2019t.

     "Investing is the business of dreams. Nobody wants to own x shares of blank, people just want to get rich so they can live their dream life. \n\nWith that being said, your first investment should be yourself. Grind down any debt with a bad rate, invest in your education and skills, and lastly establish a 6-15 month emergency fund. \n\nOnce that is done I recommend your first $15-20K go into a S&P 500 index (ticker VOO or SPY). This will give you exposure to the top 500 American companies. I have my entire 401K in VFIAX which is a similar fund through Vanguard. \n\nNow comes the fun part. You have skills giving you income and you have a little bite of every delicious apple on the money tree. Now is where you differentiate. Create an investing thesis. That is something you think will drive growth for years to come. I recommend something in your field of expertise, but it doesn\u2019t have to be. \n\nOnce you established a thesis, go through the stocks that are doing business adjacent to that thesis. Look at what they are priced at (P/E), market cap, free cash flow, revenue, net profit, insider buys/sells, general trends/sentiment, investor ratings, and I could go on. Try to find stocks that fit your appetite for risk, and match your temperament. \n\nI was buying GameStop at $7-16/share. But I wasn\u2019t emotionally ready to sell when it peaked at over $400/share. I ended up selling around $60, over 4x my money, but I could have had so much more. You have to learn from your mistakes. \n\nGood luck!"

     "I have been a Schwab customer for over 35 years. Great company with great representatives and excellent free research tools. I suggest you buy a Schwab mutual fund or ETF tied to the S&P 500. That way you will have a nicely diversified holding that tracks the major companies in America. After you learn how to research individual stocks and decide what kind of investor you want to be, ie. Growth oriented, value oriented, both, etc., you can start adding individual companies to your portfolio. Investing can be rewarding and educational as well as fun as long as you understand there will never be guarantees with your purchases. While it is not gambling, there is risk. Doing research and carefully choosing your companies will minimize that risk. The key is to keep adding to your portfolio on a regualr and consistent basis no matter what the market is doing. That is called dollar cost averaging. Hope this helps, getting started can be overwhelming. Mark"

Search You Tube, talk to some financial advisors near where you live, read some articles, etc\n\nI, personally, would buy XYLD and use the dividend to purchase additional shares each month.  It's dividend is currently at 13% (If I could go back and invest $50-$100 per check)\n\nNext, I would learn how to sell covered calls, and paper trade stocks like TSLA, AAPL, META, GOOG.  In about a year or two you will have a good Idea on how the process works and how you can make money if the stock is going up, going down, or sideways. \n\n I don't believe the stock market outpaces inflation and taxes, so my strategy may be very different than your thinking.\n\nHere is some good advice I received, through various learning sources, over the past year:\n\n\\- Don't trust any advice or advisor.  Take in what they say, learn how to do a fundamental analysis of a company for it's future cash flow, and make your own decision.  You are the one taking all the risk\n\n\\- There isn't a big pool of money waiting for you to get your portion.  A very large number of companies will fail each year, and a large number of companies cannot outpace inflation and taxes.  learn how to be market neutral.\n\n\\- if you aren't willing to put in a lot of time understanding the market and companies, you will most likely fail.  May get lucky from time to time, but over the long term, doomed.  If you don't want to put in the time, stick to what makes you money and focus on that.  Learn to save, and find a financial advisor."

Learn how ETFs work first before you buy one so you know about how the indexes move the market before you buy some of these bigger companies. Learn to look at valuations and ask yourself a simple question: Why am I investing? Are you wanting additional income stream, multiply your money, insulate yourself until retirement from inflation, make a living on it, or all of the above? If you let us know what you want, people can maybe point you in the right direction. Some of those things are harder than others but at least you can know what kind of strategies people employ. \n\nex: People who tell you to just buy VOO or VTI are not doing you a favor if you want additional income streams.\n\nPersonally, the biggest companies and even monopolies will always be unable to hold their edge into perpetuity. Just look at the East India Trading company or the railroads of the past. Therefore, google, microsoft, amazon etc aren\u2019t great investments to me bc they will neither give me stable dividends, 2-3x my money, nor are they guaranteed to stay as mega corporations until I retire. I would rather focus on speculation and dividend generation. But I know that is an unpopular take here."

This is what young people don\u2019t get. They\u2019re investing 1200 a year for 5 years.. that\u2019s only 5-6k.

Compared to the 100 a month into a low yield low risk asset. Yeah, that\u2019s okay if you have a million dollars. Most millionaires and billionaires do that. They buy low risk (or even no risk stuff like bonds) which yield 2-3-4% and they\u2019re happy with that. Cause they\u2019re so rich. But you\u2019re not rich my friend.

When you have millions of dollars or even a good paying salary, okay start, but right now with your lower wage job, research hot sectors, ask people that seem like they have insider info, and speculate into a company with a lot of potential.

VOO just invests in the top 500 companies by market cap, while VTI includes small- and mid-cap companies, which many people think are going to over-perform in the next year or so. But VTI is still a broad ETF and brings the protections against major loss relative to picking individual stocks like VOO does."
