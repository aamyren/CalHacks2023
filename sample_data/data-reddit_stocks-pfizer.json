  "Text": "b'I noticed Pfizer stock is at a 1 year low this morning. Figured it is a stock that as the COVID pandemic begins to go away more that we will just see it go down. Then realized it is Pfizer that will possibly buy up another company Seagen ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/pfizer-merck-seagen-pharma-stock-price-c7161fc2](https://www.barrons.com/articles/pfizer-merck-seagen-pharma-stock-price-c7161fc2)). Looked around some more and after all things considered it appears Pfizer is a buy. Many analysts say buy ([https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PFE&p=d)). I also say buy. \\n\\nWhy is Pfizer down though? Could it slide another 20%?'",

However, earnings have been skyrocketing only over the last 2-3 years. Historically revenue, gross profit and operating income as well as net income has been either very volatile and pretty much flat since 2002-2005. \n\nI would argue that it's not cheap enough at the moment."

For some reason the market penalizes it for having had a Covid windfall; yeah the comparables won't look great, but that's a plus not a negative at today's near pre-Covid prices.\n\nThe only thing is I don't think Pfizer is going to prioritize the shareholder with its cash. Their management makes clear they want to acquire companies, which while good for future growth is bad for someone looking for share buybacks/dividends. The best bull case is a very anti-trust inclined federal government. Still, probably a decent boring investment to hold. Not sure if will outperform SPY though."

The shares surged 11%.\\n\\n>The drugmaker said in a statement on Friday that it was no longer taking new patients in a clinical trial of the treatment due to the overwhelming efficacy and planned to submit the findings to U.S. regulatory authorities for emergency authorization as soon as possible. \\n\\nThis is amazing news.

Looking to get in on what I hope will be an upcoming tsunami for weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro.\\n\\nHere's the the deal.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk is priced at $162.5 and a div of 1.47% (roughly $2.38 yearly).\\n\\nEli Lilly is priced at $427.10 and a div of 1.06% (roughly $4.52 yearly).\\n\\nBoth are solid and in not worried about them that much.  I can get $6.26 div on the Novo from the same cost of Eli, more than 2.5 times.\\n\\nBut the div isn't the reason I'm looking.  The weight loss drugs are going to be HUGE.  The potential can already be seen in these stocks over the last year.  Novo has the better div and already has FDA approval, giving them a head start.  Eli however, has the drug that has shown to be more effective.  By up to 5% and should get FDA approval within 12 months.\\n\\nI COULD split funds and get both, but due to what I'm working with, that would be some small positions.\\n\\nThoughts on this?\\n\\nSide note...Pfizer has a good div and is trading down lately, but they hav\"",

If you want more information on when it is likely to be approved for weight loss, hop on over to the subreddit. There are doctors and researchers who occasionally weigh-in (haha, bad pun, I know) with the information they have been given. Some say the end of summer, some say by the end of the year. My guess would be winter through early spring. \n\nAlso, check out the lengths users are willing to go through to stay on the medication.

Now the only thing about this is do you want to start building a position now (I'd argue fairly risky as its a fairly new sector to go mainstream so alot of these companies might not make it through the coming recession), or do you wait out the coming recession and then start investing. Me personally I'm going to wait for it to start hitting the fan and this is one of the first sectors I'll be DCA'ing into."

It's been slow lately, so probably due for another run up in a year or so. That should coincide with the expected price spike from the next havening, so I think it's still worth a look.\n* Tesla devaluation. The stans will hate me for this, but they are rapidly losing their edge (and Elon's attention). Ford Mach E is on par with the model Y. Rivian, Ford and GM all beat them to the punch on a truck. Cybertruck is years behind. The semi is finally coming out in beta. Build quality hasn't improved. The only positive I see is their profit margin which will rapidly evaporate as they keep losing their first mover advantage.\n* Zombie company fallout. Lots of large, legacy S&P companies valued way higher than they should be, well over a reasonable P/E. Specifically tech companies.\n* Quantum computing will be here shortly too. Once people figure it out, it will break computing and AI as we know it."

     "I would look real estate ADJACENT. It'd be worth it to see which companies are expanding and buying commercial real estate, as any expansion COULD be seen as a sign of growth, or at the very least, a bubble period. If the company continues to do well, you'll see an increase in revenue, which can only be good for investors. If not, you can still hold out maybe an 8 month bubble? I mean, the rising stock price could last longer than that, but usually a company will know within its first year of expansion whether or not that was a sustainable cost, indicative of employee number growth, and the ability to still meet quarterly fiscal goals and market predictions.\nI'd pay close attention to metropolitan real estate, especially. It's a little easier to read about and stay updated on when any expansion like that will be having job openings published in their local news papers, and it's just easier to research that way, as there's just MORE business in metropolitan areas. So, condense your search down to one area that you can track thoroughly and frequently, and I think you have the best chance at finding the stocks that are right for you, instead of trying to follow market trends and analyses.\nYou can take a look at the data, or you can just look around you.

  "Text": "b\"Hi everyone. Please forgive me if this question is simple but why is a share of Moderna or Biontech so much more expensive compared to their counterpart Pfizer? Biontech has a P/E of 64, Moderna has a P/E of 51 and Pfizer has a P/E of 19 so that explains the price differences on the surface but if like to understand why. Are Biontech and Moderna overvalued or Pfizer undervalued? Is there expectations for growth for the two companies but not Pfizer? I guess I'm looking for help in understanding the differences in the P/E in order to understand the stark differences in price. Thanks guys!\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: thanks for all the helpful answers and for staying on topic and not making me feel stupid! Also thanks to everyone awarding post.\"",

If you look at Moderna's most recent quarter for example it was $6.46 EPS, much higher than previous quarters. If you annualize that, the P/E ratio is actually less than 20."

     "Moderna and BioNTech have patented breakthroughs technology (mRNA delivery used for COViD for vaccines) that could have applications for nearly any condition. Their pipelines include vaccines for cancers, malaria, sickle cell anemia. Moderna is in trials for a flu vaccine that covers all four strains. That alone would be a market worth tens of billions of dollars per year. There are 60M flu vaccines given in US every year in large until now bc the vaccine often doesn\u2019t work well or work at all bc their are 4 flu strains the they have to guess which strain to make the vaccine for each year. Drug discovery is traditionally very complicated and very expensive. Huge pharmaceutical companies can go years producing large market drugs which make them billions in profits but they go off patent in a fixed time (how long in the market depends on how long the development process took bc they patent the compound at discovery and then go about testing and developing it which can take years). The huge difference with Moderna and BioNTech is that the delivery system is always the same. They just have to figure out the mRNA target protein or antibody. So they don\u2019t have to create a new compound every time. I don\u2019t think this last part is actually priced into the stock, but it is secondarily bc it allows the companies to find and produce new applications and target new conditions and diseases very quickly vs traditional drug development. As an example, Moderna had their vaccine ready 3 weeks after the DNA sequence of COVID was released! The rest of the time was just the FDA trials. The previous record time for a vaccine to be developed was 4 years!"

     "The value of the underlying technology platform carries a higher relative value for BNTX and MRNA. Both of those are early stage, high growth biotech companies, so they're not really valued based on sales, the sales are just a great plus. Both of those companies are more mRNA therapeutics plays, including for cancer treatment and infectious disease vaccines. For Pfizer, being a mature pharma, theyre valued based on their profitability. Theres also relative market caps. If the value of the mRNA vaccine for each other them is like $5B, that will only drive a small rise in Pfizer stock, while MRNA and BNTX skyrocketed.\n\nTLDR. Pfizer is a mature company, valued on present day income, MRNA and BNTX are speculative biotechs valued based on future earnings potential, they would even be valued using earnings if not for the COVID vaccines"

If you ask what car manufacturers are the better buy and compare the P/E ratio of Tesla with the one of Toyota or Volkswagen you come to the same conclusion than with these Pharma stocks.

The vaccines no doubt will help their net income as much as it would for moderna or novavax.\n\nTo prove this Pfizers Net income in 2019 was 16.2 B, it's net income for the second quarter of 2021 us about 5.6B annualized this is about 22B. So about a 30% increase+ 3.5% dividend makes sense.\n\nModerna, although not really showing a profit, probably largely due to massive RD spending, made about 1.93 B in revenue in the second quarter of 2021. In 2019 they made a net total of 6 Million in revenue. So going from nearly $0 in revenue to 6B in 2021 would have a major effect.\n\nJust to reiterate, although the vaccine has a positive effect on revenue for Pfizer, because Pfizer is so book and has so many different medical products even a product that that generates a lot of revenue may not end up actually having much of an effect on the stock Price."

They spent a ton on research to develop the COVID vaccine and probably won't see much profit from it.\n\nYou really need to look at the whole company and how they operate to figure out if some new thing is going to be wildly profitable or not.\n\nAlso remember that the vaccine is just two shots. Once people get them, they're done. Compare that to their other cash cows, like Viagra, where people pay a bunch of money for pills they take every week for years and years."

The good ol\u2019 pump and dump. TSLA hasn\u2019t been a penny stock since the beginning so let\u2019s say they were a mid-cap at worst since the start. \n\n- Low-cap to mid-cap is a world apart compared to mid-cap going large-cap. It took some big companies to go from mid to large cap at least 2-4 years but a fresh stock like TSLA did it in less than 4 years. It\u2019s not a value stock but growth.\n\n- Situational advantage. Did anyone give two sh*ts about EVs 5 years ago? They maybe gave about one shit \n\n- A new business model. Big IBs like BAC, JPM has been the \u2018founding fathers\u2019 ever since the dinosaurs, but see what happened to PYPL, SQ. The fintech industry came and it made the big boys look \u2018outdated\u2019. \n\n- Modern figure. Now i\u2019m not comparing Elon to Einstein or Steve Jobs, but if it were to the popularity contest, Elon would easily win. I\u2019m not saying it because i\u2019m a big fan of Elon but objectively speaking, who do you think young adults looks up to? Who has the most buzz? Jeff Bezos? Bill Gates?"

     "When it doesn't make sense its not you its the market. Musk himself said his shares are overvalued in march 1st when they were at $90 per share. JPMorgan gave TSLA $90 price target. It happened in 2000, and it will happen again. It might not still be a full bubble that will burst, might take some years or interest rates change, bond yields change and more time and more FOMO. TSLA might go to $500,000 per share, no one gives a fuck until its going up, until it doesn't. Just take their cash flow of the first years they were public, their amount of cars and other products and calculate their annual growth rate. Compare that to the price and ask yourself can this company make 3,600,000 cars alone next year + other products they make? Sounds stupid doesn't it.\n\nThe market goes up and down constantly just check historic S&P composite chart.\n\nDon't forget PFE has a 209B market cap, so its hard for it to move. BNTX is 25B market cap and its much more up this year. Also PFE CEO sold most of his shares and that made so many people sell stock.\n\nNew game changing stocks are good when they are reasonably priced. Looking at ARK ETF holdings. You want to buy good companies at a reasonable price. There are plenty of them still hit by Covid, that will do great when everything is back to normal.\n\nDon't stop doing what you're doing, learn more about fundamental analysis, economics market history.\n\nMarkets aren't always rational and if you are smart and think 10 years ahead, you can make lots of money from there inefficiencies in the market.\n\nThere are explanations from economics and you can say people are betting on future companies, who will lead innovation, so people don't want to miss out especially a Tesla number 2? Like who wouldn't want a 400% return? + there is more people investing than ever before with google searches of investing booming.\n\nIt depends on your risk tolerance and your goals of what you want to achieve?

Their market cap must double for your share to double too.\n\nRight now apple is valued at 2 trillion dollars in market cap.\n\nTesla just recently became a $658 billion market cap company. \n\nTesla grew by nearly 10x this year. This means tesla's market cap was around $65.8 billion at the end of 2019 (approximately).\n\nIt's much harder for a company like apple to double its market cap from $2 trillion-->$4 trillion, and thus for you to double your apple stock, simply due to the amount of money required. It may happen, just not very quickly. Apple is too big already.\n\nIt is much easier for a company like tesla to double its market cap from $658 billion-->$1.3 trillion, and for you to double your tesla stock, simply because there is less money required. It's a smaller company, so doubling your initial investment is much easier because of the capital required to do so.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: fixed apples market cap, which i had previously written as 4 trillion. It definitely has a 2 trillion dollar marketcap. My fault, it was late."

This was zero surprise to me. Can tell you another company that will see a similar jump in a few weeks if you like, along with a few others to keep an eye on. It astounds me people are surprised by all this from a medical/scientific point of view. It's been slated to happen in November for months.\n\nBut my question to you guys is - is this really worth it? Pfizer stock was $36 on Friday, jumped to $41 today. Not to be sniffed at, sure, but hardly mind-blowing stuff is it? Or have I got this all wrong?"

News articles are saying it will be 13 billion between them and BioNTech, so 6.5 billion. \n\nCompared to something like Lipitor which made up to 13 billion/year during patent protection and made 2 billion last year while competing with generics, it really doesn't move the needle that much for them."

The requirement of 2 separate shots 3 weeks apart does not sit well at all. Especially for those in life or death situations needing immediate and quick acting vaccines. Then their are also severe logistics issues considering the vaccine requiring extreme sub-zero temperatures for transport. This makes it hard to distribute the vaccine and would likely require localized development which is costly. I don't know....it just seems like Pfizer's entire vaccine development has been too rushed. Perhaps too many corners were cut, plus the FDA being told to allow shortcuts and prioritize the vaccine development just seems too unsafe to me. They are literally taking a process that normally takes years in the making and coming up with something in months. Pretty scary if you think about it."

So Pfizer's got this now, along with a soon to be approved vaccine for RSV and what looks like most of the market for the annual COVID-19 vaccine. The also acquired a therapeutics company, ReViral,  for the treatment of RSV, putting them in position to have all the solutions for RSV as they have for COVID.\\n\\nAssuming they settle the dispute with Moderna over IP claims within the next X years, they could emerge as the leader in vaccines. I know many have worried about its ability to continue generating the insane amount of money it has raked in from COVID vaccines, and it looks like those concerns are being answered. \\n\\nI suspect given its huge cash position ($33B end of Q2), it will continue shopping for cool new therapies to add to its pipeline.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

Yes, it's a financially successful and stable dividend company, but whether it outperforms the market in the next decade probably depends on random FDA decisions and clinical breakthroughs--too much of a blackbox to predict like you can the ad revenue that Google generates.

Pfizer was the wild card because they didn\u2019t take government funding up front. But now they have struck a deal and agreed not to sell the vaccine for a profit. Moderna is the sole remaining company who claims they will profit from their vaccine but they lack any leverage to actually do so.

We are on the same trajectory with COVID. Either it has mutated into a weaker version, or else society has seen enough exposure that we are developing resistance on the way to immunity. Governments might splurge on a round of vaccinations, but they probably won't be lining up for a second round after nowhere near 100 million people opt for the first round."

     "Idk if I'd buy any individual health names, but I honestly like PFE a lot, at least at today's prices. I bought/sold it for a small profit in 2021. It's basically the same company as 3 years ago except it trimmed off $40B in debt and has loads of cash ready. And is much cheaper than several of the alternatives, who had an amazing 2022. While PFE has had pretty bad comparables coming out of Covid so its share price hasn't moved up as much. (I think I read an article in Barron's about PFE which is quite nice, or maybe it was S. Alpha)\n\nThe only problem is PFE, and its peers, are probably going to be doing a lot of M&A to grow the pipeline rather than buybacks/dividends (although they already have generous dividends). E.g. Seagen. So they aren't as shareholder friendly in my view. So I don't really know if I care to elevate them in my portfolio beyond market cap weights. The only problem is because of my various sector tilts / individual holdings, I am *really* underweight healthcare.\n\n\nNo comment on UNH/TMO/DHR as I know nothing about them. And I'd avoid any kind of biotech companies as those are lottery tickets."

     "This is what I think:\n\nNumber 1: Why average down in PFE and wait for a pop and get out? What's the point of that? If its just because you don't like seeing red, that's a bad reason - if you really, really believe it will come back up than go for it but pharma can be a pretty meh business. I'd either hold that sucker or sell it and write it off as a loss, as there are better companies in healthcare. The COVID bump is over for them.\n\nNumber 2: Healthcare is seemingly a great, defensive sector - I personally own a lot of it, but don't forget that medical debt in the US is ridiculous. Everyone - except maybe only the affluent and probably just the very affluent - hates how our current system is set up. I'm not saying any additional regulatory pressure is coming soon, but you can't rule it out. If I were to invest in healthcare writ large, I'd keep my finger on the pulse of potential regulation.\n\nNumber 3: All that being said, I kind of really like the tools/medical devices area. It under-performed last year and I think is setting up nicely to outperform - once again (after a decade of significant over-performance) - in the coming years. \n\nI also like how this sector is under somewhat less reform scrutiny - when someone gets an outrageous medical bill it's often the drug prices/ambulatory/managed care/hospital stay costs that stand out. Out-of-sight, out-of-mind, I'd say is a good thing in our society. Demographics and health trends, too, are on the side of medical devices (as with all healthcare). I'm by NO MEANS an industry expert so please take my view with a huge grain of salt but from what research I've done, it does seem like this area is particularly well-positioned both for the intermediate and long term. I hope you do more digging upon reading this.\n\nI buy the IHI on dips - if I were you, I'd take a deep look into TMO and ABT."

     "Here is some research I have compiled.\n\n- Pfizer is working not only on more mRNA treatments, but many other kinds. You can see here the number of Phase 3 trials [in their pipeline document](https://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/product-pipeline/Pipeline_Update_08FEB2022.pdf?1LyL7HgKeLza5jVNXvCDNKZhykNz2IGT). They have between 25-30 drugs in each of the Phases (1, 2, and 3), and then 10 in the final 'registration' step. This adds up to a total of 89 drugs in some type of late stage clinical trial. Merck has about 30 drugs as well in Phase 3, but a much larger 79 in Phase 2. But Merck also didn't successfully benefit from Covid-19 like Pfizer. Both have similar P/E ratios.\n- Their P/E ratio is extremely cheap: 7.7 trailing, 12 forward; the sector median is 21.\n- They are constantly coming up with new collaborations, like using genetic editing to treat diseases. For example, there is a recent collaboration with BEAM pharmaceuticals [(Source)](https://www.biospace.com/article/pfizer-triple-partners-for-future-mrna-vaccines-and-genetic-medicines-/). Moreover, \"PFE has bolstered its pipeline by multiple acquisitions such as Arena Pharmaceuticals, Array BioPharma, Therachon, and Trillium Therapeutics Inc since 2019.\" Source: a SA link I cannot post.\n- Free Cash Flow (FCF) is substantial, yielding more money to spend in R&D, share buybacks, dividends, and investments. \"Sales of its COVID-19 vaccine have provided a windfall of cash for Pfizer over the past 12 months. In 2020 and 2019, the healthcare giant accumulated $11.6 billion and $10 billion in free cash flow, respectively. But over the past four quarters, its free cash flow surged to $29.2 billion.\"  The FCF figure of 29.2 billion is a third of Apple's FCF of 93 billion, for comparison. [Source](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/12/3-growth-stocks-that-have-generated-179-billion-in/)\n- Moderna, by comparison: \"Moderna had 14 non-Covid drugs in its pipeline as of a few months ago, one of which is late-stage. Pfizer has 100, 25 of which are late stage. Moderna is too Covid-dependent.\" [This is quoting a comment I made a long time ago, but I don't remember where I sourced that statistic.]\n\nMy takeaways are: It's a very cheap stock; there is a lot more to it than Covid, although it will continue to reap benefits from it; it has tons of cash to spend; Covid demonstrated their innovative ability, not to mention their past history of success.\n\nRisk: they seem to have a patent cliff in 2024, but their robust pipeline makes this less worrisome. Also, mRNA vaccines may not be successful, since I believe a fundamental problem with this type of technology is poor longevity, compared to traditional DNA vaccines. [I need to recheck this again.]"

     ">Do you think Pfizer is undervalued right now due to incorrect interpretation of future vaccine and anti-viral drug sale projections?\n\nI believe Pfizer is trading at a very slight premium due to an incorrect interpretation from the market of COVID related sales going into late 2022 and, more importantly, 2023-2025. I expect such a revenue to actually taper off, not grow, sharply.\n\n>More a more general level, do you think Pfizer is going to wisely invest its covid windfall and develop great revenue streams?\n\nI think Pfizer already has invested some of the COVID related profits wisely, though they remain behind the industry average for R&D investments if I'm remembering right. Pfizer sports 89 products on their pipeline, ten of which in the process of being registered (5 COVID related).\n\n>Do you consider Pfizer a great buy or not? Is this a long term hold? The pe ratio is 13. Is that considered normal for drug companies?\n\n1. I think, despite saying earlier it's trading at a premium, it's still a decent *investment.* I'd wait before pulling the trigger though.\n2. Yes, Pfzier is a long term hold. Aside from sporting a healthy dividend TTM 3.04% yield (39.69% payout ratio), which is already attractive to me, Pfizer has a substantial stable moat in the Healthcare space. A diversified product catalogue and no patents expiring till 2028 (Eliquis comes to mind) alongside a strong distribution network all help to keep it's pricing power for drugs in the company's favor.\n3. Pfizer's p/e ratio of 15.83 (where did you get 13?) is fairly competitive with other companies in the industry. Similar to other companies like $NVS and $MRK that I'd recommend to others for due diligence research."

     "While secreted antibodies have a half-life, the B cells that produce them stick around as memory cells and continue to produce more antibodies.  That's part of the reason why you only need a booster of the tetanus vaccine every 10 years and the HBV vaccine doesn't need a booster at all as an adult.  Trying to predict future antibody titers based on IgG half-life is an exercise in futility.\n\nAdditionally, you cant compare antibodies generated from infection to antibodies generated by the vaccine.  Many of the antibodies you produce during infection are useless for neutralization as they will target non-spike epitopes.  In contrast, all antibodies you produce from the vaccine are targeted against the spike protein."

     "LOL.  A bunch of European countries cannot even decide whether the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe.  The on again/off again decisions about it have scaremongered people into not wanting to use it.  Now they are suing to get what they were refusing to use.  This really looks like a cover-your-ass move for leaders responsible for an incompetent vaccination rollout.\n\nMeanwhile the U.S. and the U.K. spent billions on R&D and building production facilities before vaccines were proven efficacious, betting on multiple possibilities in hopes that at least one would work out.  \n\nEuropean incompetence makes makes me wonder whether we can take advantage of their shambolic vaccination program by first making money with recovery stocks in the U.S. and U.K. then moving some of the profits into recovery stocks in the EU.  Maybe three to four month gap is too short."

But a vaccine is not like a car or a subscription plan, there will be a very highly concentrated spike in demand (which we are seeing now) and then a drop off as the disease disappears. \n\nThirdly,  as I mentioned and so have others, this is not a profitable vaccine and they themselves did not develop it."

I tend to add to the stocks that I feel are performing below their true value. \n\nHowever, I respect the diversity strategy I laid out (i.e., I said I would invest X amount into Stock Y over the course of the next year. Stock Y recently slumped to ATLs, which would make a great DCA opportunity. However, I have already invested the X amount I planned to invest into that position, so I am not adding more to my Stock Y position. I am capped out on Stock Y. I respect that allocation I planned out.)\n\nI respect my plan and keep diversification in mind at all times because I feel it'd be very easy to over-expose yourself to a particular position by DCAing too much just on the feeling that it is undervalued. Sometimes, the dip keeps dipping. Sometimes, it sucks. However, plans are there for a reason.  For protection. \n\nRecent examples where I encountered this very situation:\n\nI wanted to add to my Pfizer position in December, but then it went on a rally around my pay day. I didn't like that this rally brought it to near ATHs. I opted to add to another position. \n\nThis month, I felt PayPal was undervalued. It started to rally.

LOL! They have no real data on the efficacy of their vaccine in humans. The stock price is through the roof, and the Moderna executives are selling their stock!! ([https://www.randomstock.net/coronaVaccine](https://www.randomstock.net/coronaVaccine)). \\n\\nPfizer has just entered the clinic with two drugs. more info on each drug in the above link. They seem to be doing more due diligence before going to the clinic than Moderna. Pfizer thinks both drugs have a chance, and they have the money to back both.\\n\\nModerna just seems like a circus act. Maximum speed, tons of press, and the executives just cashed in big time. I'm talking 10's of millions by multiple execs.\\n\\nPfizer seems good. measured and steady, they will bring us over the goal line.\\n\\nZack\"",

A lot of people dumped the stock after it pumped on results because of insiders selling but the results themselves were just as reliable as other vaccines for Phase 1.\n\nI'm not to familiar with BioNTech. MRNA is a difficult one to believe because, insider selling, no therapies to market, never before approved therapy, and they are against Bio Giants that have actual therapies under their belt and some manufacturers are using proving delivery methods."

Typically, anyone who could have access to financial data ahead of public disclosures have limited trading windows after results are announced to trade the stock. Also, there may be restrictions on how they can trade in that trading window. For example, suppose a company releases quarterly earnings on April 15, July 15, October 15, and January 15. Executives and people with access to financial data may only be able to trade the stock in the month following release of financial data (e.g., May 1-31, August 1-31, November 1-30, and February 1-28). Also, since an executive selling a large amount of stock could be viewed as bad and drive the value down, some companies also require key executives to give 30 days notice of their plans to buy or sell stock. Again, it is to prevent insider trading. If you are able to read that the CEO is planning to sell $1B '",

     "Pfizer is a huge company. People don't understand how big that company is. The cap on Pfizer is $217B. At one time they were one of the top five largest companies in the US (By market cap).  \n\nBy contrast, AMC is a \"micro cap\" company with a market cap of $393M. In other words, Pfizer is almost 1000 times larger than AMC. Red Robin has a $277M market cap. The hotel chain Marriott has a $38B market cap; much, much larger than AMC or Red Robin, but still about 1/8th that of Pfizer. \n\nFurthermore, Restaurants, theaters and hotels have lost HUGE chunks of business due to the pandemic, whereas Pfizer has lost virtually zero business due to the pandemic.  Once a vaccine starts becoming used by the public those restaurants, hotels, theaters (and casinos and airlines, too) are going to get much of that business back, whereas, it will only represent a small amount of Pfizer's total business."

I understand its still early in the day but just curious on everyone else's insight.  It seems like everytime I see a company come out with good news ther stock spikes even if just for a day before dropping back down. I would think because of the pandemic and the unique time right now that pfizer would go up? All view points appreciated\"",

     "Pfizer is a huge company and even though they have great news on the Vaccine front, I don't think it's going to move the needle a lot on the stock price. Much of that is already \"added in\" to the price. I do think PFE will go up some, but not a lot.  I think there are better opportunities. Once a vaccine is approved, I think you'll see the stock prices of hotels, restaurants and casinos move much more than Pfizer.\n\nThat said, I do own a few shares of Pfizer and I intend to hang on to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs far as a trading platform:  I use Webull, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Schwab.  I buy most of my value stocks on Fidelity, most of my Tech stocks on TD Ameritrade and most of my ETFs on Schwab. I have a few shares on Webull in an account that I opened just to see what the platform was like. I don't like it as well as the others.  I also had a RobinHood account for a while, but sold all of the shares I had in it. \n\nAs for platforms, I like Fidelity the best and if I could only use one, that's the one I'd pick. However, if I traded a lot of options or if I did a lot of day trading, I might prefer Ameritrade for the ToS app.  I don't use the ToS app that much because I don't buy/sell on a daily basis and I prefer the research tools of Fidelity.  Fidelity is very user friendly and has a lot of valuable information on it."

     "Pfizer and Mylan are both attractive but I\u2019d stay away from Teva unless one wanted to wait for the stock price to drop even further; it\u2019s possible we could see a Mylan / Upjohn like merger or a buyout \u2014 both of  which would be a big boost for Teva and a win for investors who bought the dip. \n\nPfizer highlights:\n\n1.) A healthy 3.4% yield\n\n2.) Relatively clean balance sheet\n\n3.) Pfizer has managed to stay (mostly) out of the water on opioid epidemic lawsuits and thus legal expenses and repercussions that have pummeled other pharmaceutical stocks like Mallinckrodt (MNK), and Teva for that matter, have been avoided.  I would categorize Allergan\u2019s recent lawsuit against Pfizer differently than an \u201copioid epidemic\u201d related case. \n\n4.) Best management out of the three; look at the recent R&D turnaround story as an example.\n\n[Pfizer R&D Turnaround ](https://www.lifescienceleader.com/doc/the-story-of-pfizer-s-r-d-turnaround-0001) \n\nd.) Shedding Upjohn has been met unenthusiastically by investors but I think the reaction is over done. Spinning off generics makes sense. The risk of diluting PFE\u2019s share price is, however, a real one.\n\ne.) PFE is trading at relatively reasonable multiples due to recent market-cap losses as a reaction to the Mylan / Upjohn deal. \n\n\u2014\u2014 \n\nMylan is the only other reasonable choice in my view.  The primary risk is that generic manufacturers continue to face troubles and political uncertainty.  Nonetheless, I view the Upjohn deal as more of a win for Mylan than a win for Pfizer. This sentiment, which seems to be shared by the market and thus already priced in,  makes it less attractive.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nThe only reason I would buy Teva is if it were to get even cheaper.  The biggest potential tailwind catalyst for Teva\u2019s stock performance would be for it to get taken over in a buyout. It has lost hundreds of millions to battling opioid epidemic settlements and legal expenses. The past few years have not been the brightest for Teva.  It\u2019 financials are not as healthy as Pfizer\u2019s either. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nPolitical uncertainty is a risk factor for the entire sector as far as I\u2019m concerned, and I\u2019ve been avoiding any stocks particularly exposed to political risk until after the 2020 election. There could be major overhauls in the entire healthcare system and big changes in regard to pharmaceuticals. Regardless of changes in policy, Teva has a lot of work to do to rebuild the prominence it once had."

The more complicated one is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model which adds up all the company's future earnings based on various assumptions and compares to what the market prices the company at today based on the stock price.\n\nA simpler, more approachable model you could use for your assignment is the Dividend Growth model - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordongrowthmodel.asp\n\nYou could also compare various valuation metrics of PFE (the P/E ratio, Price/Sales, etc) against other companies in its industry and use that to make an argument that its over or undervalued."

This is the world recovering from the pandemic. It isn't sudden, it isn't at a snap of the fingers, but this is happening. COVID-19 is just yesterday's news that's still causing echoes.\n\nThe only long-term risks that are obvious right now is players with bad intentions on the global scene. Dictatorships try to undermine free societies, so they sow fear, doubt, disinformation, while strengthening their own positions. I can't shake the worry that at some point they might spread their wings and do some damage to neighbours (aside from indirectly killing millions by sowing disinformation about how vaccines are bad)."

In the grand scheme of things those are all really solid time tested companies though except Tesla of course. I have no idea how many of each you have and you may end up with a short term gains tax bill every year but the amount you will make on premiums alone could be monumental. Just make sure to stuff away 30% of those premiums in a high interest savings account. Something like SOFI offers. I think they have the best interest rate on the market currently."

Can I just keep the stock and maybe have it continue to grow?

From my experience a merger offers you a share conversation (example: for every share you own of company x, you will get 1.5 of the new company or in the case that it's less than a whole share, they credit your account for that). \n\nMy guess is you'll probably end up with some shares in Pfizer if you don't take the cash offer now but I could be wrong as I didn't look anything up on the deal or hear about so sorry if any of this is wrong."

PE is based on the *last* twelve months.

The companies that are considered dividend aristocrats have a long history of consistent dividend increases. Just remember to pick the company based on more than just having a high dividend yield. A company giving an 18% dividend isn\u2019t very good if the stock loses 50% of its value. Also if you don\u2019t need the money right away and your brokerage platform allows it I highly recommend making sure you have dividend reinvestment turned on. This way your dividend income will increase without you even trying."

     "r/dividends is pretty good if your looking for recommendations. Also remember higher dividend yield is not always good. Make sure to look at the free cash flow statement and see how much they are making and how much they are paying out to investors in the form of dividends. A lot of companies will try to entice investors with a higher yield but not be able to afford it. Here is a list of the dividend aristocrats as a starting point in research.\n\nhttps://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/articles/dividend-stocks-aristocrats\n\nYou can tell high quality companies if they gave a decent yield while not having to big of payout ratio and also doing share buybacks at the same time. For example LMT has a decent yield of almost 3% while paying less then half their cash towards their dividend. They use the rest of the money for share buybacks and investing back in the business. Obviously do your own research, the list and the sub is just a starting point. Good luck!"

A lot of the traditional big market disease states (cholesterol, blood pressure, non insulin dependent diabetics) can be treated quite cheaply with old generics that work really damn well.  Take Lipitor (atorvastatin, a pfeizer drug) for example, the local grocery store pharmacy gives the generic away for free.  And a lot of \"new drugs\" these companies come out with are garbage and ripe for being throat punched as scrutiny around health care costs intensify.  Take \"Duexis\" for example.  That is ibuprofen (advil) and famotidine (pepcid) packaged in a combination tablet. --I mean ground breaking stuff right?  Both drugs have been out since Armstrong walked on the moon.  And it costs a fortune and some how some insurances and state medicaids have been conned into paying for it.  Granted that is not a pfizer med, but it's an example of some of the shit companies without a really good innovative pipeline are doing.  So I guess in short, are they making a difference?  What good ideas do they have?"

     "I agree C and INTC are cheap. But I\u2019m not willing to invest heavily into either of those businesses YET. In my humble opinion, they\u2019re both turnarounds. They both messed up badly under their previous CEO\u2019s, and brought in new CEO\u2019s to turn things around. And like Peter Lynch said, I\u2019d like to see real evidence of them turning around before I really invest in them.\n\nI look at C like the 4th best pizzeria in a town with 4 pizzerias. Even if they\u2019re selling their business to me at a cheap price, I don\u2019t think I want to buy the worst one in town. I would rather wait until they become maybe the 2nd best in town, even if it means I would have to pay more at the point. \n\nI look at INTC like the big old store in town that keeps losing customers to the newer stores that opened up in town. Sure, it\u2019s still bigger, making more money, and I can buy it cheap. But I don\u2019t know if I wanna buy a store that keeps losing its customers. I would rather wait and if I see them gaining their lost customers back, I\u2019ll buy that store, even if it means I have to pay more at that point.\n\nI know many people would disagree with me and that\u2019s fine. We all have different styles of investing. This is just what I\u2019m personally more comfortable with.\n\nEdit: Forgot to say, kudos to you, OP. You put a lot of work into researching.

They also have another vaccine (RSV) that was granted FDA fast track, and their CMV vaccine is in phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nThey have many other vaccines and personalized cancer treatments in their pipeline too.\n\nCOVID is expected to become endemic, so COVID shots will be a regular thing like the flu. They are also looking into creating a 4-in-1 \u201crespiratory vaccine\u201d which includes COVID, flu, hMPV, and RSV, which would be taken annually, which could help sustain profits and fund research in the pipeline. They started collaborating with outside partners for an HIV vaccine, have Epstein-Barr in the pipeline (virus that causes mono), and have a vaccine of a potential contagion-like virus in early stages of research (Nipah if you\u2019re curious)\n\nI was hesitant before, but now I plan to buy more, they crushed earnings and still have a lot of doses to go. Their P/E ratio went from about 280 to about 45 before opening today, and their profits grew by 1272% over a year (technically very undervalued compared to the P/E, but stock only has been around for 2 years, so take it with a grain of salt).

I console myself that I surely would've taken profits months ago. \n\nAnyway, you sell a put option which obligates you to buy 100 shares at whatever strike price you select, if the stock price is below that point on expiration date. For example, you could sell the 9/17 put with strike price of $360 for $6.35 ($635 since its 100 shares). So, no matter what, you get paid $635. If the stock is above $360 in six weeks, nothing happens and you have $635 in your pocket. If it's below $360 on 9/17, you buy 100 shares at $360. That's a 25% discount to today.

  "Text": "b'**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 23, 2021**\\n\\nStocks rebounded today, rising to fresh records after last weeks volatility as fears surrounding a potential taper timeline, as alluded by the Federal Reserves latest meeting minute, receded. Like I said last week, I viewed the dip following the meeting minutes as another overreaction by the market. To reiterate, I remain very bullish moving forward until the Federal Reserve starts to discuss a potential interest rate hike, which I expect in late 2022-early 2023. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday. In my opinion, he likely will not reveal any additional details regarding a potential taper timeline in order to avoid another taper tantrum.

Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant.

  "Text": "b' \\n\\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**\\n\\nThe stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). \\n\\nWith roughly 89% of companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. \\n\\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\\\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/'",

Yes, there are a lot of factors in play but you have to realize that the market expectation just shifted from \u201cwe may have a somewhat effective vaccine\u201d to \u201cwe likely will have a very vaccine\u201d. That is huge.\n\nNow the fact that there was a run-up to the run-up and the drivers behind that I find more squishy than the vaccine news. Will be time for value stocks to shine for a few weeks / months and I\u2019m sure there will be some discounts to be had in tech as the market has less correlation across sectors for a bit. But there is no sign that means to stop investing but agree with you that maybe you want to be more careful.

It's anti-democratic. Even if these states do find a few messed up ballots, we already know the fraction of what they find in a recount will not change the outcome of this election. \n\nTrump is making this really hard on me to keep sticking my money in U.S.-based company's. An ugly transition could lead to the next stock market bottoming out if any of these conspiracies gain traction or they do find \"massive\" fraud which, in their heads, had to have happened even though they picked up seats in Congress and may not even lose the Senate majority. Shit is getting insane. Misinformation is everywhere. And this pop for a COVID vaccine that will not even start making its way to the public for months will be premature at best."

After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserves July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then.

     "Here\u2019s my double D:\nTL;DR: Most the drugs are great, Xeris has great potential (to be BO). + a pinch of salt (see below)\nThis randomised controlled trial doesn\u2019t quite convince me that the combination of insulin and pramlintide would be a game changer (https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/diacare/early/2020/01/16/dc19-1922.full.pdf) does it have potential? Yes. Will it be implemented? Depends on the price and the severity of its gastrointestinal side effect profile.\nDoes the diabetic drug have a huge market cap? Yes (https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-insulin-market). Will it be able to capitalise much? Probably (Gvoke is pretty good!). The combination of both insulin and pramlintide is being deveoped by ADOCIA(M1Pram) too. As far as I\u2019m aware, the insulin + pramlintide is patented by Stanford (Eric Appel), not by Xeris(https://patents.justia.com/assignee/xeris-pharmaceuticals-inc?page=2)\nHowever, I think this is decent DD and I thank you for your service."

     "This is a legitimately undervalued stock and totally worth buying right now.  I bought an institutional sized position back in the summer and haven't sold a single share, yet even with the run up the current value is still way below where it should be and I continue to buy shares with any free cash.  I strongly believe this company will be an easy buy out in the $20-30 range in 2022 or sooner, although I hope it stays an independent company forever since the company operates in recession proof niches and will continue to make money regardless of what happens in the market.  Solid and growing pipeline, huge potential for XeriJECT and XeriSOL technologies, potential partnerships coming soon, retirement funds have been buying, BlackRock owns 7.5% of the company, and so much more.  Although it could be a volatile coming year, over the next year or two I know we will be up significantly.  Average target price is $12-14 and this only takes into account it's approved products and doesn't take into account the technology that allows the company to reformulate compounds without water and allows the company to store medical compounds without refrigeration like their competitors products (think vaccines or antibodies)."

This is simply an expensive way for Pfizer to both get the inversion that they wanted so desperately and bulk up the company in preparation for a likely break-up in a few years.\n\n\"The possible long turn investment return from this massive $160 billion merger is undeniable.\"\n\nPfizer hasn't exactly handled prior past purchases well, no reason to think that the company will do better this time around. \n\nPersonally, I'm going to wait and see on the whole thing. If Pfizer doesn't get the deal done (and I still think there's a chance they may not), Pfizer probably goes back to floundering along and being a decent income play. Allergan really hasn't responded all that well to the deal news; I think it may go down a *little* if the deal was off tomorrow, but will probably go on being a pretty decent growth play.\n\n\n"

The fact that in less than a year they had the chance to test a product that would otherwhise take more than 10 years to get approved by the FDA. On top of that, it proved their technology to be safe and effective. Most likely getting FDA approval in record time from any other med ever created. And generating the capital and name recognition to fund their pretty extensive pipeline of products all based on the same technology... this is incredible IMO. It is like timetraveling for healthcare. This is why it is easy for me to explain their valuation and potential in healthcare. If the HIV vaccine is half as successful as the covid vaccine, It would mean so much to healthcare and science in general. Even the potential to create cancer vaccines is mindblowing. Only this could have made possible by the situation we are in right now. Specifically operation warp speed where all restrictions and liability was lifted by the goverment on top of the billions of dollars pumped to make it happen so fast."

I started beginning of September and quickly became interested in what affected stocks, especially after the evergrande news and the Facebook whistleblower.\n\nI used fidelity to create watch lists based on the daily buys and sells by their customers, along with noting the daily % change, any significant news, and if earnings reports were near. Also would take note of what was mentioned on this sub along with r/stockmarket and just watched. Learned very quickly that there\u2019s no predicting the market, at least with individualized stocks.\n\nAnother thing I like looking at is the biggest daily movers, not something to make decisions on but often times there\u2019s a correlation. For example several biotech companies are down today.\n\nOverall, all I\u2019m saying is the more you look into it the more you realize there\u2019s no predicting the market. It\u2019s one of those things you hear constantly but seeing it first hand helped me a lot personally and just furthered my interest. Good luck to ya!

The tradeoff is that it does pay out enormous rewards and high returns are possible without holding through the big headlining binary events (FDA approval, CRL, etc.) I also do not play PDUFAs\\n\\nSo right away, a couple of things.\\n\\n1. **By being long on a company, you are also holding a long or short position on its competitors.** As a very recent example, Iveric Bio doubled overnight because its competitor Apellis Pharmaceutical reported disappointing trial results for their own drug.
