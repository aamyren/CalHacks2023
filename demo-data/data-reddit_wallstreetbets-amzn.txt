	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:39:39'] That’s all he can afford because his getting married again.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:42:36'] If he’s going in, I’m going all in.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:22:30'] He’s the only one who bought. And he made money.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:14:59'] This must be some kind of “keep your account open minimum” or something.  Like it resets his password if there’s no transactions within a time period, LOL.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:14:23'] It’s a way to trick algos. Isn’t considered manipulation in SEC terms. This is the legal way to do it. Algo see insider buying >0 and they flick to buy mode.Amazon Will pump shortly so they can do some selling into retail buying.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:34:53'] Probably a tax thing, exercising the option for one rather than getting taxed on the whole lot or something.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 15:19:17'] he's so bullish on $amzn he thinks 1 share will be worth $1T

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 14:49:09'] Poor man has probably never bought one of anything. He just wanted a taste of peasant life.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:58:54'] I'll take one share Vasily, one share only.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:09:01'] I'll match him at that.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:01:20'] Wouldn't this technically be illegal insider trading if he didn't preannounce this purchase?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:37:32'] He was just checking if buy button works on his brokerage account.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:47:44'] Anyone explain why he did this? It must be a tax planning move?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 13:56:41'] He bought 1 share?

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:55:36'] I wouldn't be surprised if it's just to be listed as buyer for some index reports. Like they just list if large shareholders bought or sold shares during a period. Buying a share makes amazon green instead of grey or red.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 16:59:29'] He lost that bet with Mortimer from Anacott Steel

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:42:13'] 990 MILLION shares
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:45:06'] So Jeff Bezos only buys 115 shares and the market is rave about it ?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:54:31'] It’s probably against some law or agreement to sell a bunch of shares without buying any.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 18:57:43'] What a stud, I wish I had that kind of money to put into AMZN
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:03:42'] There’s going to be 10 articles from every news site on this.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:13:58'] CFO sure doesn't have a lot of confidence
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:23:15'] Hey just gave away 2billion worth of stock to a “non-profit” so I guess he is going to build back his port one stock at a time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:47:40'] He did buy it at 4:20 tho
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 19:51:17'] Notice how Jassey is a seller. I give him a year to turn things around over there. Otherwise he will be spending more time with family.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:39:34'] Of course Brian O. the CFO gets the best sell price
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:42:57'] Maybe it's a residual fractional reinvestment. They accue fractional share options along with their regular shares and then can buy them once the create a whole unit.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:44:11'] Where to find him buying stocks??
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 20:56:59'] He’s likeI did it as a meme with my buds on my yacht

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:24:44'] Maybe he has DRIP setup idk
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:44:48'] Are these compensation, not actual purchases? Like the company giving these to them?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 21:49:23'] It's a hidden message!He has 990,545,661 total shares. It's a composite number, so it's not referring to Amazon *prime*. So what are its factors?1x3x3x7x1913x8219Look at the first 4 factors: **1, 3, 3, 7**. He's telling us he's one of the elite!**1913** was the year before the first world war broke out.8219 has a digit sum of 20, a digital root of 2, and a length of 4. **2024**!World War confirmed next year.**Calls on $AMZN and $LMT for drone warfare.**
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:04:48'] Lol nah. He downloaded Robinhood
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:19:36'] He believes in this company.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:41:07'] The stock split was part of his plan to finally afford a whole share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:52:48'] He probably has some contract stipulation that he has to purchase stock or lose his price/discount on stock options so he can buy a single share to extend the terms of his vested options.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:56:41'] At 420 lol this is probably a code for situation 69
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 23:59:44'] And he bought it @ 4:20 pm 🤔🤔
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 00:36:33'] Trying to trigger those algos.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 01:01:09'] Brian has my respect, a nice and even number.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 01:25:02'] You know what they say. There are hundreds of reasons for selling a stock, but only one reason to buy.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 04:52:42'] Have to offset all that other selling somehow…
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 04:58:24'] Must be the one I sold.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 05:56:31'] I genuinely do think this is a message for people from Jeffy B that he thinks AMZN is a fantastic buy right here
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:06:43'] Hope he doesn't pay too much tax on gains of 1 share.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:07:52'] I shit you not, thought that was a Valorant after game screen lmao
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:38:39'] Bought it at discount. He trynna say something here 🤣

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 06:51:34'] I heard he’s engaged, maybe getting ready for second divorce.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 07:20:22'] We don’t talk about it when he buy 1000 shares of anything. He wants the attention
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 08:12:59'] He's trying to undo what damage me bying one stock of Amazon will do.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:12:20'] He is saving for a hair implant, but Musk haven’t tell him where did he get it.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:14:15'] My man’s don’t like even numbers
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:19:17'] His gf is fake AF. I dont know why he would date somebody who has had so many cosmetic surgeries
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 09:36:10'] In all seriousness, why would he buy just one share?From which app/website is this screenshot taken?
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:12:53'] I love how the CEO of their most profitable business (AWS) has the least Amazon shares amongst the five insiders.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:43:35'] Fuck it, going to take it as a sign and jump aboard 😂🫡
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 10:53:47'] An ass share
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:09:38'] thats allot of fucking money
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:22:40'] And he’s up 4.65%
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 11:36:46'] Clearly just cutting his cost per share and averaging down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:03:18'] He likes the stock! ![img](emote|t5_2th52|29637)Jassy ![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787) , why would you need 2.6m in one day.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:40:42'] His plan is to buy one share a year in order to dodge any insider trading charges.
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 12:43:32'] Divorce has been rough
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 16:43:08'] Fat finger trade!!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-28 23:16:11'] It's just a test... A test to provoke emotional response!
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 06:50:21'] he's trying to dollar cost average but not very well
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 12:58:28'] This bitch 😂
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 00:12:10'] His assistant didn't hear the million part when he told her
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-30 05:19:20'] The cfo having 50k shares should tell you something.. everyone else is holding a bag of dicks….
	COMMENT: ['2023-05-27 12:52:42'] It looks like Amazon execs have been busy insider trading again. On May 25, Jeff Bezos bought 114.77 shares at a cost of $1 per share.

Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 11:00:22'] >The Amazon earnings report is due out today after the closing bell, and I am expecting strong results. The company has a history of beating Wall Street's expectations, and I believe they will do so again today. However, there are some potential challenges that could impact the stock price, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. Overall, I think the stock is a good buy at current levels and expect it to produce strong returns in the next 12-18 months.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 19:40:46'] The biggest warning sign with this company is that Michael Griffin, former head of NASA and a director on their board, sold his entire stake in the company back in December. It was 1.8M shares so not a small amount. It's entirely possible he is the biggest moron ever. He wasn't one of NASA's best administrators. It seems more likely though, that he knows this company is going nowhere and he wanted to cash out before the share price drops any further. I wish you luck though.

Amazon’s sat business wants to procure complex parts for barely more than the raw materials cost, with extremely invasive oversight into the operations/ financials of their suppliers. Basically they want to pay what they would if they manufactured in-house, but shift all of the risk to a sub tier.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:00:17'] Caught that slip too. But it's also been the worst kept secret in space for months now, so I don't know what they thought they were gaining by not announcing it. The fact that Kuiper (a mega constellation) is going to need a new factory worth of reaction wheels isn't surprising. I guess there is no better place to announce it than the biggest space conference.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 09:11:36'] How does this help the SP? They've already announced the deal and the fact that thousands of reaction wheels will be sold as part of that. That revenue should be priced in. The specific partner involved doesn't seem like it should matter all that much.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 23:56:38'] I’m expecting growth stocks to all reprice to the downside with the imminent recession, which would lead to a better opportunity to buy leap calls on the rocketlab. As the market corrects 5-10%. Growth should drop +30%. Rocketlab would be $2.5-$3.That would be the best risk to reward opportunity.Since we don’t know when the announcement will be and there are storm clouds on the horizon for the growth industry with interest rate headwinds, it’s not best to buy call options right now. Shares would be safe but the opportunity cost associated with them are not appealing enough for me.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-20 06:35:47'] This doesn't add up. Project Kuiper is a ~10 billion dollar project from Google, and just looking at how much reaction wheels cost as a % of a satellite, it's about 1-2% of the total weight of the sat. SpaceXs sats are like 10-100k each, and even if they were a million Rocketlab isn't getting a billion dollars from Kuiper, which as you pointed correct wants ~3k sats in total. It sounds like this is a good deal for rocketlab, but you're wrong on how big of an idea it is

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 10:47:30'] Might wanna take some off the table now, the fact that it's up 5%+ tells me people are getting ahead of themselves so it might go up less after earnings. Edit: ngl I hadn't checked spy in a few hours, didn't notice it absolutely ripped past 410, prob good to hold all these into earnings cause I guess it's mostly up from the market.

POST_TEXT: b"Sup fellow degenerates, gather 'round and let me tell you the tale of how I banked a sweet $12k on $AMZN shares while the rest of you paper-handed fools prob lost stacks or broke even at best. So, buckle up and let's dive into this rollercoaster of a story.\n\nIt was earnings week for the tech giants - you know, the likes of $META, $GOOG, and $MSFT. And then, the star of this post: $AMZN. I started building my position back when $FDX beat earnings in March, grabbing 500 shares at a neat $100/share, and then adding another 1000 shares on April 21st just under $107.\n\nWhy, you ask? Simple. More packages = Ecommerce boom = analysts being dumbasses. Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos baby.\n\nSo, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT & $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $M"

URL : b'https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/125ui0d/anyone_else_think_amzn_is_going_to_pop_off/'
POST_TEXT: b'Ive been almost fully invested in Amazon for over a year now. I originally bought really high at around 150 before the entire market decided to crash. When it did, I took the opportunity to buy more and so now my avg cost is down to 102. Currently holding about 150 shares.\n\nI want to try and gauge market sentiment on Amazon here by seeing what you all think. Is it going to continue flat around $100? Is it going to surge tomorrow? I have definitely noticed a trend for the last few weeks or even months that it tends to spike up on Wednesday and Thursdays most often. It seems like there is a lot of resistance, presumably from people who dont fully understand the breadth of Amazons offerings, their leading position in ALL retail segments, and the insane investments in automation they have been/are making.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?'

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 14:47:43'] Traditionally on Thursday’s the market goes up or down.
	COMMENT: ['2023-03-29 16:16:54'] Amazon added 750k workers, out of which about 150k were white collar workers, in 2 years and opened a whole lot of fulfillment facilities. This is a huge drag on their cash flows. They need to cut way more than the 27k they announced to turn things around on cash flow basis. Unless they take steps in that direction or announce new lines of revenue I do not see it turning around. So you might see it in the 90 to 100 zone for some time. If you are in it for the short term, try and exit at close to 110.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 07:29:50'] Mackenzie donated to my university, however instead of using those funds to upgrade our modem’s or fix our cafeteria or buy new single person study tables (it’s a commuter school). They decide to invest the majority into gender and cultural studies, which there is nothing wrong with that but the staff (10) they hired make easily $170k per person, and no one has seen them available. They make more than the typical professor of psychology or biology. Also, they supposedly had grants but no one has received one as far as I know. Wonder where the rest of it went.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-22 07:07:46'] it seems like Amazon is the company behind the undisclosed deal with Rocketlab. The Amazon project Kuipar, a huge satellite fleet, is potentially worth billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years. Adam Spice, Rocketlab CFO, attended an event and did a presentation, answering questions regarding the new reaction wheels. He gave away too much information and the information seems to point to Amazon's project Kuipar.

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-21 22:24:05'] Dude. If you were an expert in this field you’d know a few things:1.	It’s fucking spelled “Kuiper” not “Kuipar”2.	Kuiper is a long ways away from even launching those 600kg satellites. They’re launching two small test satellites at the end of the year. Launching the bigger satellites is sometime in 2024 - at best. 3.	most importantly - Kuiper is building their reaction wheels in house. Kuiper is notorious for wanting to control their components. On the last item, here’s a quote from the Head of Kuiper- >	“Affordability is Job One for us,” said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. “That’s really important for us to keep that cost low, because if we don’t, it’s very difficult to get the unserved and underserved connected to our service. So we took on the challenge to design our satellites two orders of magnitude cheaper.”>	There are no glimpses, however, at the satellites themselves. “We’re designing the solar arrays, we’re designing the reaction wheels,” Badyal said.A $100k reaction wheel is fucking expensive and can definitely be made cheaper.Edit: this is either an obvious P&D or OP has no idea what he’s talking about. My comment got downvoted seconds after I posted it. Someone didn’t like the factual information.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-11 17:30:37'] So you bought the 95 strike long calls when Amazon was somewhere between 99-101?  So you paid the time premium and  ~5/share intrinsic value - and then sold your calls pretty much at the money?  I think your best hope is Amazon dumping about 4 bucks a share tomorrow so you can buy back those short calls.  Of course, I have to bet against you a bit cause I have $60 long calls at the same exp.  I bought back my $107 short calls on the dip and if it pumps this week I’ll be selling them back again but always way farther otm Still rooting for you as much as possible

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 01:51:37'] Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) is overvalued according to its current market capitalization of US$1.1 trillion when compared to its gross profit of US$225.2 billion and net profit of -US$2.7 billion in the last reported fiscal year ending December 31st, 2020 . The company's P/S ratio of 513x and P/E ratio of n/a further indicates that AMZN stock may be overpriced at its current level
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 05:44:14'] They spent way too much on people and infrastructure during covid.  Granted some was to meet unprecedented demand but you have to wonder why nobody questioned whether or not conditions were temporary or the new norm. At any rate I don’t see them having a problem returning to profitability. Positions: I’ve already bought calls for their upcoming earnings release. 5x 105$ call may 6th expiry I think.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 01:58:14'] Amazon is having a real shit time trying to transition from growth to value. The kinda peaked and now are losing customers due to third party seller shenanigans, increased competition, and a string of ventures that just haven't paid off. Not to mention labor issues, regulatory scrutiny, and a bitch of a COVID hangover.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-05 14:56:48'] Amazon's stock will trade flat unless they split the company up into separate business units.  They have built many business units that continuously lose money (like grocery) or that failed entirely (like healthcare).  Their retail business has no logical curation and is overwhelmed with Chinese companies selling low-quality goods, resulting in Amazon.com becoming a digital flee market with a home page filled with inaccurate recommendations.  These same 3rd party sellers are upset because Amazon is raising fees, taking over 50% of an item price to pay for logistics & delivery.  Meanwhile Walmart & Target now offer fast delivery with no membership required.  Anyone who is still bullish on Amazon is ignoring all of the problems they need to fix to keep growing.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:00:42'] I was under the impression this deal was more about the real estate and facilities.They wanted in on the grocery delivery business and purchasing an established chain is a lot easier than building X amount of brick and mortar locations.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:51:52'] I worked at whole foods for 3 years when I was in school. In my opinion, yes, it is expensive. However, there are certain items that are 100% worth purchasing at WF vs. another grocery store. I buy most of my seafood and meat there, like salmon, beef, chicken. After working behind the meat counter for 2 years I really do believe they sell a sustainably sourced, ethically raised, and better quality product than other supermarkets. That being said, don’t buy everything there. You’re buying the same milk, produce, bread, and eggs there for ~20% more than another grocery store, for basically no improvement in quality. They also sell certain speciality items like fancy cheese and coffee brands that you can’t find elsewhere. Overall there are things worth buying there, but don’t do your whole grocery trip at WF.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:24:51'] Whole foods is nice to shop at because no one is there and it's quiet. I mean the prices are not great and they have most of the same produce and other products other stores do but at least it's quiet.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:13:27'] >It is clear that the Amazon-Whole Foods deal has not been as transformational as it was made out to be. However, I believe that this is due to the fact that Amazon is still in the process of digesting Whole Foods. Once they have fully digested Whole Foods, we will see a more transformed company emerge.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:52:04'] I really think competitive supermarkets have upped their healthy food game…And, kept prices lower than Whole Paycheck…Not that beating Whole Paycheck on price is that hard.I really thought Amazon was gonna radically lower Whole Foods prices…to kill off the competition…but, they never did.Amazon definitely hasn’t maximized this acquisition.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:30:47'] I think it worked out great for Amazon. They don't give a shit about Whole Foods, but they get to use every Whole Foods store to test out their automated buying service, which they'll they start selling to other stores. All your data will go through AWS and they'll be able to recommend you products on Amazon that go with the stuff you bought in store. And I'm certain they do some eye tracking stuff to see where you stopped and paused in the store, to know what your interested in even if you didn't buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 13:48:53'] Less of a variety of products all the time, WFs seems to be replacing everything they can with their 365 brand. Most cashiers replaced with self-service checkout stations. I hate giving money to Amazon but in my area, all the food co-ops are gone and there aren't many alternatives for certain products.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:29:53'] I was  Whole Foods customer for many years and since it was acquired by Amazon it has been nothing but a constant disappointment. Not the pl e I use to love.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:01:41'] Idk about other places but the Whole Foodsnear me went downhill in quality after Amazon bought them. Maybe it’s not working because they nuked what worked forWhole Foods
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:57:33'] The quality of my local whole food dropped immediately after Amazon bought them
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:00:25'] I was worried that Amazon would tinker with the high prices by cheaping out on quality. I shop at Whole Paycheque for certain items precisely because of the quality. However, there is one item whose quality has gone down. The pizzas used to be sooo good. Had one recently and the dough was terrible. I since have asked an employee what was up with the dough and he said they no longer make it but get pre-made dough in big boxes. So no more pizza :(
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:27:29'] I drop off my returns there all the time
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:38:37'] Lol what's with the paid comments buffing off Whole Foods?
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:51:12'] Amazon killed the Wholefoods culture. My wife worked at Wholefoods for 20 years, started as a part time job in college, she loved it so much she decided to turn it into a career instead of using her education degree to become a teacher (the first woman in her fam to not be a teacher in GENERATIONS. Not a scandal, but a hard choice she backed up with evidence of working at a place she loved). 20 years of climbing the latter and working her ass off. Providing a good life for her boyfriend. She loved it, she was happy. We moved a couple times for the company. Amazon takes over. Wholefoods people were worried at first, but the immediate changes were all good or neutral. Until covid... it immediately became a wholefoods warehouse. People being managed by the minute rather than the shift. Restroom breaks discouraged. Paranoia, firings, managers walking out mid shift (managers, not just part time employees, managers walking out).
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:43:43'] They are pricy, but just about all that they sell is some top shelf quality. I like them for their bread, meat, fish and chicken. Their bison is excellent too. Veggies are high quality too, but I have other places to shop for that with quality just as good but better pricing. The staff are always friendly and helpful and the stores are well lit and clean. Is it the only place I shop at? NO. I also shop at Walmart, Aldi's, Trader Joes and Target. I could never get everything I wanted from one store.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:00:39'] Whole foods is meh,  co-op and erewhon are better
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:12:56'] Honestly I only use it for meat and seafood since the quality is bonkers compared to all the other grocery options around me, but I’d forget them in a second if there was a local alternative
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:16:52'] It was a transformational change for me. It transformed me from being a Whole Foods customer to someone who now avoids their stores.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:17:39'] I used to work at Whole Foods. Most food is overpriced but it has a reputation of supplying high quality meat and seafood. Rich people love Whole Foods. I definitely noticed that Whole Foods prints tendies. Middle aged dads love the beer selection and middle aged moms love the wine.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:19:09'] Whole Foods is no longer cool. It's Trader Joe's now.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:38:50'] Personally, Amazon being involved made me less likely to shop there.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:46:38'] I want to shop there, I just can’t afford too.  Even the budget grocery stores have an organic section.   There are some exceptions.  WF has an unparalleled bulk nuts/grains/berries section if you’re into that shit.  They are getting their ass eaten on other fronts.  They are relying on their name at this point rather than the service they can provide.   I can sniff out the same quality of products at better prices on my errand runs, so long as I’m willing to make 3-4 stops in a week.  If they want to capture my patronage, they need to bring their prices in line.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:55:40'] Whole Foods used to be amazing. I used to love their hot foods and produce. Everything has legitimately become so banal there between Amazon taking over and the effects of pandemic. I used to legitimately drive out of my way to grab a coffee or beer there with a little snack. Not anymore.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:57:30'] We greatly reduced our shopping at Whole Foods once Amazon took it over. Used to hit it up at least once a month. Usually 2x. Now we go there about 3x a year. Only cuz there’s something very specific we can’t find elsewhere. From 12+ times a year to 3.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:27:10'] Never went to WF cause it’s expensive as fuck but now I don’t go to WF because it’s expensive af and fuck amazon so two birds one stone it’s nice. My parents recently discovered WF tho and they spend like $90 on cheese and jams weekly now
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:30:39'] As a former WFM employee who was there for the ‘15 restructure and then the AMZN takeover I can only offer my view. Fundamentally WFM was behind the curve in org design and efficiency measures that while they tried to fix, only compounded problems in culture. Having no clear plan and direction with buy in from all levels created a us v them mentality that was brewing under the “alls well” mentality. Grocery retail is a fickle animal that I think is turning into the battles of regional powers like Wiegmans or H-E-B that national brands cannot compete against. I think the WFM banner will be gone within a decade with maybe the 365 line remaining in some version of Amazon Fresh as they have to cut the fat.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:07:36'] Prices are too high like Publix, selection is limited like Aldi and customer service is mediocre like Walmart. That’s why I don’t shop at Whole foods.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:34:57'] Let’s see. Service and quality at Whole Foods has declined. Amazon shoppers jamming the aisles. Produce department is hit and miss. Checkout can be a complete nightmare. Certain items are 50% more expensive than at Traders. Just not sure there is much for Amazon to brag about in this acquisition.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:27:00'] It helped me, I love that they save me an hour driving if I want something from whole foods.  Although they messed it up a bit when they split the delivery service into two unrelated sections, Fresh and Whole Foods, no idea why they did that and you can't get every item on both sections, nor are they delivered together.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:43:14'] [deleted]
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:47:09'] Well I used to go to whole food now I don’t 😂
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:06:08'] I like to think that some people stopped going to WF specifically because Amazon bought it.  There’s always Trader Joe’s.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:40:32'] Yeah yuck it up meanwhile Amazon is literally your only source for everything

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:50:45'] The Whole Foods purchase was meant to help box out and threaten/attack Walmart. "Get off our online turf or we might fight you on your home turf" It was never expected to make a profit directly.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:00:30'] It’s become a shithole.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:45:54'] They closed our fancy Whole Foods and moved it down the street as an Amazon Fresh in an old Ralphs building.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 18:14:34'] I don’t understand. The only way it was “transformational” was helping amazing get a grocery business. I’m speaking only from experience shopping at austin Whole Foods at least once a week for years. Also shop at heb. To me the Whole Foods is mostly the same. I hate to say it but the little Amazon enhancements have been nice like features in the app that help me shop etc. I think many people MAY not realize that Whole Foods has lots of products they DONT contain shitty ingredients. Not every product, but lots of them. It’s costs a little more but, as others have said, the two store system really works for me, HEB fills in the items that are too expensive from Whole Foods. I do throrougly enjoy going to Whole Foods downtown in Austin though. Lots of smiling happy people, clean store, good selection if you want nicer items.  Lots of beautiful people lol.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:05:03'] I shop at Whole Foods way less after the acquisition. Quality of product is down and the Amazon integration is cringe at best.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:11:10'] Quality of many 365 products went down. Hot food item quality has gone done. The meat and produce for fresh is awful.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 19:59:16'] Whole Foods is a higher end grocery store. It’s great for some harder to get products and I go there a lot for meats that my cheaper store won’t have as fresh or high a quality. I don’t go there for milk though.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:25:56'] Dude 3 years ago I worked next to a whole foods. I ed coffee was 4.95 a cup and it was like $1.50 more than Starbucks or Dunkin. It was 100% worth the $5.00. best coffee ever. Some of their products are absolute slam dunks. If it was 7 dollars today I'd still buy it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:59:36'] Sorta missing the point of an acquisition. If you aquire a well performing business and make zero changes to it, you've done well. Don't know the ins and outs of this story, but as long as Whole Foods didn't start losing money post acquisition, then it was still a smart move.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:27:39'] So much photoshopping in this picture. Clearly turned those shrunken heads into lettuce.

The original company was antithesis of what Amazon is, and I don’t know how Amazon didn’t understand that. Probably because they’re greedy fucking pricks who think they can do anything at this point

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 12:35:57'] AWS is a cash cow. There is literally no other industry or business that generates as much cashflow. Theyve reached a point where investing in AWS has diminishing returns but they have nothing better to do with their cash, so MBA consultants are going to make shit up for amazon to expand into because "psynergy" and "innovation".Same can be said for facebook/meta.their advertising business plateau and they have nothing better to do with their cash than to speculate on the future of web3. At least bezos isnt going all in on a speculative future product like zucc did with metaverse.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 21:39:30'] I worked at whole foods before the merger and I worked there after the merger, I completely disagree with this article. Big changes came into the actual stores as soon as Amazon started sending down their directives.   In my particular store we introduced online ordering/pick-up, introduced truck-to-shelf inventory, and a few other changes that made working there a completely different experience.I never did truly understand *why* Amazon wanted to purchase it in the first place, but it gave WF a nice influx of money to upgrade their stores. Not a bad place to work and their product line-up is pretty great. I'll never forget the time the dairy team broke me off a vegan snickerdoodle ice cream cookie sandwich. Eating that thing was an orgasm for the mouth the entire time.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 00:59:22'] It was great when it was included in same day delivery with prime.

I was there a week after he left and the food there was overpriced (as usual) but it was all junk. It was always overpriced, but for a long time the takeout was quick and good. When I was last there it was terrible. People were not helpful, much of the healthy stuff they had was gone and even the overpriced pizza looked like trash. No oversight.[https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/whole-foods-ceo-resigns-healthy-america/](https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/whole-foods-ceo-resigns-healthy-america/)

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:01:25'] A 14 billion dollar acquisition of whole foods sounds like child's play and a no-brainer compared to the market cap of places like Costco and Walmart. If anybody, Amazon has the infrastructure and scale to turn whole foods and do a 200 plus billion dollar cash cow.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:13:20'] Amazon fresh is slowly expanding and taking up real estate through the less expensive areas.  It’s putting in items with more favorable profit margins while still offering the same look and feel of Whole Foods.  Give it 3-5 years and you’ll see Amazon fresh as the marquee name that all Whole Foods will eventually become.  Once the Whole Foods name is gone, expect the profit margins to go up higher as they squeeze value out of the chain
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:51:40'] It's just overpriced hipster groceries lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 14:39:34'] I hate Whole Foods. The produce is good but still not as good as HEB and it’s even more expensive.The meat selection at Whole Foods sucks and it’s priced at highway robbery prices.The things I go to Whole Foods for:-Christmas trees. Every year. Best deal in town and the service is good. You have to get them literally the weekend they get them in or they will sell out.-my crunchy wife loves buying supplements/vitamins. I think they are a waste of $ but they have good selection.-beer selection is good. They have an especially good selection of German import beer -the bulk foods selection is good. If you want a little bit of specialty flours etc. it’s the best place to go. All said and done though- Central Market is the best grocery store in the US. Nothing else even comes close. If anything Amzn buying Whole Foods has caused their quality to decline overall.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 15:37:20'] Whole Foods has such a reputation for being overpriced that I haven't gone in to find out, I've peed in their bathrooms a handful of times but made a b-line to the exit. I'll go to pretty much any other grocery store besides them.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:19:27'] It helped their supply chain a bit and helped them move into Amazon fresh. Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods likely use the same chain so I think that’s the bigger play as they continue to expand Amazon fresh. I use Amazon fresh and really like it. Grocery shopping was one of my least favorite chores so it’s worth the few extra dollars to not deal with it. Prices seem about the same, you just tip the driver $5-10 so that’s really the added cost. There is less variety on meats I feel, so that’s maybe the only downside. I used Whole Foods delivery too and it seems no different then fresh but pricier plus they do $10 shipping.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 16:23:43'] No, I don't amd won't shop at Whole Foods. It has Publix vibes and Fresh Market prices.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:34:05'] I think Amazon bought Whole Foods because they wanted to know the name and address of every person spending $2.00 for a banana.  They clearly have too much money and Amazon wants all of it.But more seriously I think it was about acquiring them for the people who built a value add shopping experience.  They sell the exact same products as competitors and charge double.  Amazon wants to know how they did that and how to apply that knowledge to them because that’s basically what Amazon does - sells products readily available everywhere.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 17:39:50'] I assumed they’d try and beat local grocery pricing and then nothing ever materialized. I still check prices on dry goods every now and then but they aren’t even in the ballpark usually. I can do grocery pickup at Walmart or Meijer for way cheaper.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-30 23:47:19'] The only reason I started buying from whole foods is because I could do it from the Amazon app. Being able to drop off my Amazon returns is also a plus. Some seasonal fruits are worth the extra cost.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 00:31:11'] Whole Foods is the bane of my existence and I do everything on my being to avoid going there. It’s fucking miserable. If you’ve ever had a good experience at one you don’t live in a busy city.

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:07:38'] I just don’t understand Amazon’s long term goals in general. Fire 10% of their employees every year, project running out of employees for growth within the next few years…Their website is starting to become a shit show… I’ve gotten counterfeit items despite using shipped and sold by Amazon…. I haven’t had a prime delivery only take 2 days in like 3 years now. Got Amazon delivery service now and despite my address being exact on google maps and a big ass lighted sign with my street number they miss my house. Somehow I still keep using Amazon though…So you got this site full of low quality and counterfeit goods mixed in with the good.Then you got basically the grocery store that’s supposed to be ethically sourced, organic, quality and expensive goods… A streaming service they seem desperate to advertise. A cancelled mmorpg… It just seems like haphazard “empire” building to me. Amazon just wants to be everything and anything even if it’s shitty…
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:12:18'] I though they weren't concerned about making money with WF, and don't mind the loss as it helps with their taxes.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:21:40'] I never shop there because it is, and always has been, too expensive. I am a member of this subreddit, not a millionaire. My local grocery store has the cheap fruits and veggies I can actually afford.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:23:22'] Honestly Whole Foods doesn't interest me at all. Overpriced supposedly healthy foods. There is no budget options in that store that I could see and most of the healthier options can be found in other stores. The recession won't be kind on a place like that either.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-31 05:26:37'] The deal was about logistics, not expanding whole foods sales as a siloed business. 80% of Amazon's traditional dollar volume comes from within 5 miles of a whole foods.The whole foods supply chain is responsible for reducing costs in Amazon's "last mile" delivery. Whole foods warehouses now hold Amazon products expected to soon be ordered in that locality (bc predictive analytics)

	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 21:50:56'] surprisingly nobody mentions the fact that this company is sitting on $512.5 million in cash equivalent earning risk-free interest income as the fed continuously increases the fed funds rate. Thereby aiding the company with better ability to manage cash flow with higher interest income with limited to no debt on the balance sheet. $333 million was used to buy marketable securities of short duration fixed income now earning at least 4.5% annualized yield. So the downside risk is minimal from a permanent loss of capital perspective.
	COMMENT: ['2023-02-08 20:37:30'] >The reason I'm excited about Rocketlab's new reaction wheels is because it indicates that they are now targeting the mega constellations market, which is currently one of the hottest markets in the space industry. These reaction wheels are specifically designed for satellites that weigh 600-700 kg, which just so happens to be the size of many of the satellites being launched by companies like SpaceX and Amazon. This could mean big things for Rocketlab in terms of revenue growth, as they will now be able to tap into a market that is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years.

What time frame do you expect the news to hit in. Such a big promise of revenue would surely send the share price back into double figures.Been looking at RKLB for a while and I think this is the sign for me to pull port into OTM options - just need to know what expiration date I can get away with...

Quickly did some research, in the promotional video of Amzn Project Kuiper they mention that Amzn does the design for the reaction wheels themselves. Does that fit to the strategy of RKLB? Would they be just the manufacturer? What is the profitability of reaction wheels and how much is coming from the design?

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-24 18:33:11'] that price link is a frontier radio, whats actual wheel cost?
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-19 21:23:25'] SpaceX uses their own reaction wheel design on Starlink, and they’re way less than 120k per reaction wheel. It’s one of the big reasons why they’re able to keep the costs per sat down. Most of that cost is in the raw components, not in the integration costs.Amazon is basically recycling former Starlink engineers and their reaction wheel designs seem to be very similar, so there’s no way that they will be paying anywhere close to $120k for Rocketlab to assemble them.Furthermore, 10k sq ft is a tiny cleanroom. Not going to do 4.8bn in revenue out of something that you can buy for ~100k…

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 11:34:49'] \#1 - 1/2 of these are not catalysts lol .... CES ? our team is meeting with our amazon buyer at CES. This is our 3rd new buyer in 6 months, turn over is real and the buyers have no fkin clue what they're doing. CES is getting smaller every year because its really not a valuable show to attend, most of the stuff is prototype shit thats not even available for sale. with amazon's fee structure every company is actively trying to find more ways to sell on every platform except amazon. AWS is the only thing saving them.  \#2-#3 doesnt mean its going to be good...  \#4 CPI could go either way   \#6 It can always go lower P/E still way out of line for new era of value stocks  I'd be more interested at $60/share or less
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 10:23:56'] lol, buy it and come report in 6 mo.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 12:44:08'] I hate dumb lists... It reminds me of some people with political discussions who have lists of irrelevant things to post in response to any reasonable discussion, even if the list makes no sense.Now, to be clear I think AMZN is a great company and have invested in them before and made good money if that investment, but I did sell a little while back because I was having trouble with the value case for them (not that my other investments did much better, but felt it was time to pull out of AMZN...).So let's take a look at your list for the heck of it.1. CES 2023 on Jan 5th. - Who cares. This is an annual event that has zero impact on the long-term fundamentals of AMZN.2. Earnings Feb 1st. - And so? Every company that has declined in value had earnings at some time or another as well as every company that has gone up. It is just a day that info may come out that will move the price, not a guarantee which way.3. Last years Feb earnings was the biggest move in stock market history (+14%). - As they say in investing... prior results do not guarantee future performance.4. CPI Jan 12th. - So invest one way or another in SPY as that reflects the impact of CPI better than an individual stock.5. UMICH Jan 13th. - No clue what this means6. New 52W low. - Whoopee doo... Every stock before it reaches it current 52 week low, reached a prior one... which means nothing. Stocks can go up or down regardless of lows or highs.7. They pump the stock Feb/March because the number stock refreshers to employees is based on average Feb share price. - Ok... not even going to bother with this.8. Consensus EPS is a softball. - I think the consensus for Q4 is $0.20, which comes to under $1 annualized, which means AMZN is trading at a 85X+ PE ratio.9. Cost-cutting happening right now (layoffs 10%, Alexa deprioritized). - cost cutting is necessary but perhaps sales will be down and profits impacted in any case... meaning the cost-cutting is keeping things afloat as opposed to making them profitable.My take... maybe it goes up, maybe it goes down... definitely this DD you have done is crap though.Maybe try real DD next time... Like if you exclude AWS from the picture, AMZN lost $10 billion in the last 12 months. Or how if you exclude AWS, AMZN barely makes money. As to AWS, during the last few years growth was very strong, but has recently slowed down. In any case would take several years of strong growth to justify even current share prices. Basically an investment in AMZN is a bet that they can turn their retail business not a massive money-maker and that AWS will continue to show strong growth for the next 5 years. My guess is Q4 will not answer these questions and will leave a lot of doubt as to the future potential of AMZN and if it can grow fast enough to justify the share price.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 16:36:07'] I like Amazon as a company and a stock. I’m just wary of many tech stocks right now and am mostly cash until we see the bottom.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 10:29:53'] When qqq goes down, every tech companies go down, and we're still in a bear market. Nothing specific to Amazon will matter until the trend reverses.
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 10:59:54'] lets see what happens ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)!remindme on february 2 2023
	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 06:33:11'] >1. I believe that CES 2023 will be a very important event for Amazon. They are likely to unveil new products and services that could have a major impact on their business.2. Earnings for Amazon in February could also be extremely significant, as they will provide updated guidance for the year ahead.3. Last year's February earnings were the biggest move in stock market history (+14%), so there is potential for more upside this time around if results are strong again.4 CPI data from January 12th will be closely watched by investors as it can give clues about inflationary pressure in the economy which may impact Amazon's margins going forward 5 UMICH consumer sentiment data due on January 13th could also shed some light on how consumers are feeling about spending money online 6 If AMZN shares continue to fall and make new 52-week lows, this could trigger further selling pressure 7 Some analysts believe that employees at Amazon receive stock refreshers based on the average share price during February, so there may be some positive buying activity around this time 8 The consensus EPS estimate for Amazon is currently $1532 , which represents decent growth from last year 9 Finally, cost-cutting measures taken by management recently (such as layoffs of 10% of staff) suggest that they are focused on improving profitability

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 14:50:57'] I've read your posts and comments on this subreddit basically shilling META AMZN and other shitty growth stocks. Why not just buy ARK? How you want to invest is your business, but I would strongly caution others on investing in anything with a PE over 50 in this rate environment. Between QT and the erasure of consumer spending power, this is a very long play. Be prepared to buy and hold for 2 to 3 years for 15%.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-29 12:08:24'] OP apparently doesn't read the news about how people are abandoning Amazon due to them not providing diverse products. They act now like an ad service. I seriously do not like shopping on there anymore. Too many fake reviews, too many promoted products, too many hurdles to buy something I want. I still shop there, but they are starting to show their weakness.

When recession and inflation stabilize we are sure to see higher growth rate with more companies connect to the AWS services. **Non-AWS in 2023**It's fair to estimate that after almost 2 years of bad and unusual economy, now when things are set to be stabilizing, Amazon's non-AWS services will surpass or at the very least breakeven the -$11.4B gap they left last year.**Is Amazon a Buy?**In my opinion, Amazon is going to be facing some more slight decreases in the short term, as we haven't left inflation and recession threat completely yet. As for where the winds are blowing, it's easy to see that 2023 is going to mark the end of this weird market and the rise of companies like Amazon.   For a long term, Amazon shows a great opportunity for investment to me. But wait at least until they release their horrible Q4 report before buying.

So many things you named apply to the entire stock market - UMICH, CPI, etc.Why people like you feel the need to share stock analysis, when you probably live in your moms basement and have zero exposure to finance while you work two jobs at Wendy’s and AMC, is beyond me.

However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!\n\n**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  \nSo the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike p"

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 09:42:19'] Unsolicited advice from an old man.  If you are young, <30.  Put 20% of your income into a mix of index funds, ETFs and Bonds and watch your money grow year after year after year.  In the last six months your 20% would have been buying stock for cheap.  Trading can earn you a lot but you can see not everyone is really cut out for it.  By simply investing you'll have a 7 figure nest egg and you'll support the economy.   Cheers.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 19:52:22'] They just let go of 1% of their labor overhead. They better fucking correct..Honestly even if you take their bloated shitty online retail, and unsustainable logistics out of the equation, I don't actually put that much value in twitch or whole foods. Don't even get me started on the almost 1bn they spent for show they won't even report viewership on because it's so embarrassing. Nobody and I mean nobody is buying prime just for the streaming.Web hosting by far the most stable business but also a lot of overhead and I don't see a lot of growth potential. Speaking of which how you think they gonna raise new capital? Any way you cut it will lead to a constrained balance sheet.Market it has plenty more volatility and I don't think they will see steady growth up for a while.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 16:25:46'] At this point, I just want something close to breakeven for my bag so I can unload shares for more $SPY puts before the correction, and then buy in at the big dip.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-23 16:08:04'] >It is good to see you, DeadSol. I am doing well, thank you for asking. As for your question, the current Amazon stock price of $94.18 is below my breakeven point of $101.66, so I would not recommend exercising your option at this time. However, given the overall positive trend in the stock market lately, it's possible that Amazon's share price could rise above my breakeven point in the future and at that point it might make sense to exercise your option and sell shares of Amazon stock at a profit. Thanks for letting me know what you're thinking and happy Thanksgiving!

I could pay rent on time, avoiding $100 late fee, as well as pay off a whole credit card (\\~$100/month)\n\nUpdate:\n\nI've put in the order to sell half. Its not the best time but it might not be the worst.

	COMMENT: ['2023-01-25 00:12:56'] Cloud grew because nobody cared about costs during the boom.  It will soon enter a race to the bottom as providers fight over a dwindling market. MSFT and GOOG can sell at, or *below* cost because they have other significant revenue sources .

	COMMENT: ['2021-09-11 12:19:30'] I think many have these stories. My regret was not buying when I thought I should.  We were mostly poor, so risking money was not in my genes, the risk of losing was too high. That's what keeps you poor.  I passed on Apple in 2001 ($10 at the time, pre-splits), passed on Microsoft ($25), passed on Amazon ($75) and just messed around with ETFs.What feels worse 20 years later are the chances I never took, not the stupid ones I did take.

Our board declined a buyout and less than three years later we were sold for scraps. Back in 2003 I said it was stupid for them investing in warehouses to hold their inventory and later 3rd party inventory. Shows you what I know. I declined a job there before that offer and twice after as most as recently as 2005 was close to a pretty senior role that I was a finalist for the but just missed. So many people I know from those days that are still there stay and rack up RSU’s.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 08:48:53'] All I know is Amazon built a new wearhouse by us recently and you wouldn’t believe how quickly the surrounding roads that had been there untouched for decades have been expanded for these Amazon trucks.  They all used to be small little 1 lane roads with houses on them.  Now the expansion has pushed the roads right up to peoples damn doorstep.  If you ask me, that’s POWER.  There’s a few really nice houses borderline mansions on a gorgeous lake off this road and fuck if they didn’t expand the roads right up their ass.  Amazon can get shit done.  Look at bezos with this fucking historical Dutch bridge.  Amazon is a powerful powerful entity and I wouldn’t judge one little quarter during one of the most divisive crazed time periods in the past 10 years.  I’m just gonna hold my shares and not mess with options in this volatile market.

You don't even need to drill down hard into the numbers, the CNBC article says everything you need to know:> AWS revenue: $17.8 billion vs $17.37 billion expected, according to StreetAccountAnd:> Amazon disclosed revenue from its fast growing advertising business for the first time. Advertising services grew 32% year over year to $9.7 billion during the quarter. Previously, Amazon included advertising revenue in its “other” business segment. While advertising has always been viewed as a tangential business for Amazon, the company has had so much success attracting ad dollars that it’s now third in the U.S. market, behind Google and Facebook. Google reported fourth-quarter ad revenue of $61.2 billion, while Facebook notched ad sales of $32.6 billion in the period.Their EPS has nothing to fucking do with the jump in price. Instead, people are excited over two other massively successful businesses that Amazon is in.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 02:58:26'] Amazon will give away the gains throughout the day. The market is loosing liquidity. Its as simple as that. Last 10 years asset inflation has been rampant. Nasdaq grew 5000 to 15000 in 5 years. Thats not all innovation and tech. Thats QE and piling up fed balance sheet with historic growth. Now that QE is going away. Interest rates os going to increase. If inflation runs at 5% it will be violent. We have to get used to that stock return does become negative and asset appreciation is 2-3% a year, not like quadrupling money in a year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-04 05:13:25'] I came here to say this / agree with this.  The main part of the business is loss making.  It's only AWS that means it is making profit.  At a PE of over 50 it still needs to do a lot in terms of getting more profitable/revenue growth to grow into's it's valuation.

His light turns green and he still just sitting there and him and his friend are giggling. He rolls his windows down and he’s like “don’t you just love my rivian”? I proceeded to point right through him and say “ No, i’m waiting for you to move because you’re blocking the entrance to the parking lot“. Instantly deflated he drives off

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 12:18:25'] Wow, I hadn't really thought about that, but I guess you can't just hold your short position and get paid off after delisting, so you'd have to close it.  That means getting delisted is a guaranteed short term bounce for anything, haha.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 05:28:58'] SEC created "expert markets" to lockout regular people form trading the stock. So yes, it does stop getting traded. The only people that can trade it in the "expert markets" are large institutions. Everyone else is locked out. Also keep in mind that BBBY has a corrupt board that is destroying this business and profiting from its destruction. This is an engineered demolition. **If there was any justice, the board would be investigated and prosecuted for conflicts of interest and misleading investors.**

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 22:18:32'] This is why I trade $SPX credit spreads because they are cash settled so you have no risk of assignment ever. Plus the tax implications on your capital gains are taxed as if long term 60% /40% as if short term which is way more favorable than straight capital gains on short term investments.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-28 23:16:39'] I've dealt with td ameritrade on this. The after hours market price is factored in until about 5 or 6pm (don't remember the exact time) because options can be executed up til then. It went up in after hours. This made it in the money. This is what they will tell you because it's what they told me.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 05:54:49'] Man I feel this. In thinkorswim, on the charts you can right click and a menu shows Buy/Sell, and if you’ve got the auto send on it doesn’t even give you a review before sending.My mouse button was acting up and one day I right clicked and it clicked sell on its own, immediately sending a sell to open 100 shares on AMZN order.So I shorted like $285,000 worth of Amazon on a green market day and nearly shat myself. Yet, my stubborn ass straight up _refused_ to lose money on my own mistake and so I waited, and waited. Longest 5 minutes of my life as the thing ticked higher but then hit resistance at 2900 and dropped Closed the short for a $200 gain which actually isn’t bad,  but it in hindsight the risk was astronomical 😬😅
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 06:18:17'] On the positive side, this can gap up Tuesday morning and OP can make 10k.    But overall, always close out your ITM positions before close.  If not, you'll definitely get assigned like that HS homework bro.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 11:41:15'] I don’t think this would add much to your loss as long as you have the other leg of the spread, and clearly you gained 299k on the other leg just exercise it to cove your assigned leg. Why is everybody freaked out here!

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-30 06:41:33'] You'll prob end up ok..ish.. Broker might even auto liquidate the shares given how much into margin you had to go.The worst hit will be the margin cost across the weekend. Don't know what broker you use, but 5% margin on over 200k is gonna be a solid hit

He just needs to sell the shares first thing Tuesday. Hopefully it doesn't tank, but I think it's unlikely. He might make some cash.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-29 11:41:42'] This is the lesson where you buy to close on expiry day. I’d close it out ASAP if you think it’ll go lower. I’d still close it out because it’s slot of risk on your portfolio too much delta

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 20:31:45']  Dude, no calls until the next interest hike.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-15 20:55:17'] Holy shit you guys pick the companies with the highest P/E ratios.  You’ve got the lowest amount of upside and the highest amount of downside risk. Besides hardware companies I’m staying away from most of Big tech right now. I hold plenty of semiconductor companies and only three tech stocks. Apple, Netflix and block inc (SQ). Actually I just bought Alibaba two days ago. Amazon is like the last company you wanna buy calls for with rising fuel/labor costs and supply chain issues. Rising inflation will cut into profit margin especially if they decide to offer competitive pricing comparable to their competitors. Which, they’ve had a history with in the past. Their profit margin has always been very thin. I just wanna help some of you guys sometimes lol. Also you should make a rule with yourself to never buy an option with less then a month till rip. This is so stupid. I feel bad saying this. DM me if you want moves

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 11:41:58'] They are definitely going to beat on all metrics. It will trade sideways after the earnings announcement and crush all the weekly calls and puts, we will see the volatility crush and then next week it’ll be trading 20%+. Anyone holding calls for next week will be rewarded. Guaranteed.

Higher net income and lower operating costs (LOOOL) plus the valuation of the stocks they invested Rivian.. $110/share (valuation on the date recorded) today its $60 and still on the books.. from $6B to $1B valuation and there are money more assets still on books... people are fucking retarded and this is what fuels the "bull market". In reality im wondering how much they lost this year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 17:10:45'] Revenue missed.  Retail side was messy and bad. We all know by now RIVN artificially inflated earnings based on a share price that has already imploded 40%.  Guidance was weak. YoY earnings actually decreased.  Yes, I know people mostly only care about growth of AWS, which was good here.  Overall, this is quite a mixed report..maybe enough for amzn to stay green, but it isn't gonna save the market. It wasn't strong at all.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 12:09:41'] Retail spending was down 1.9% last quarter. All the social tech is down big. Netflix missed big. Tesla missed big. I'm betting spending just tanked last quarter due to inflation, supply chain problems, and just general poverty from the Covid lockdowns.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 14:29:41'] For everyone reeeeeing about the Rivian stake profits, don't you think that market makers (you know, the ones who make the price go up and down), can read, and did the math on that? They still beat expected EPS at Rivian's current evaluation.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 10:09:21'] My gut says they'll miss guidance but isn't most their money made on AWS? So I don't know how much less consumer spending will actually hurt them. Might even help since they offer cheap alternatives to a lot of products people are currently paying more for elsewhere.I'm definitely not playing it that's all I can say.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 11:01:57'] I honestly don't think it will be great because of the CoVID restrictions in some places were lifted. This created a psychological effect of people going out and consuming elsewhere other than the online platform where it's basically a localized Chinese product outpost. If the earnings would be anything, it may have just met, but I don't really think it would get anywhere close to exceeding. The virus is indeed disrupting normal market trends indeed.EDIT: I stand corrected with my dick in a vise.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 11:07:04'] It's not about how great amazon is it's about if the growth rate can remain high enough to justify the PE of 55.

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 06:58:32'] The data speaks for itself - mega-cap tech stocks have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin so far this year. This is due to a number of factors, including strong earnings growth and favorable macroeconomic conditions. There is no reason to believe that this outperformance will not continue in the future.
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-06 11:25:59'] Conveniently not showing the 21-22 time-frame when they crashed, and TSLA lost 75% of its value for example. Its just a tech recovery. You cherry picking whore.

POST_TEXT: b"Yesterday, 90p expiring on 11/4 for AMZN the premium for the contract was 68 cents. I bought it when the stock price was $113ish. \n\nLater that afternoon, the stock went to around $110-111 and the premium rose to around 90 cents. \n\nNow I understand theta (decay) and IV crush can happen but since the stock price actually went down to around $99-100ish this morning, wouldn't my premium also increase in value? How did my position lose more value when it's actually closer to $90 (my strike price)?"

	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 07:25:30'] Short answer is IV. Longer answer. With tech stocks being very volatile around earnings and reporting as of late, the implied volatility with so many unknowns was greater. With them releasing earnings and expectations, the unknown was now known. Therefore the stock adjusted, and upon open today the volatility has subsided. Therefore, the earnings are now priced in, and the chance that it drops another 10% in a week is low.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 07:22:27'] Earnings IV Crush always sell right at open after earnings.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-28 07:20:19'] >It is possible that the premium you paid for your option increased in value even though the stock price went down. This can happen if there is a decrease in implied volatility (IV) of the underlying security. When IV decreases, options generally become less expensive.

If ADBE can get just a fresh 10% of this sub to start posting “gain” porn, that equates to almost 1,400,000 new customers. All in calls.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 11:46:39'] It will bounce during the split. I dont know when its gonna happen. But I think it will slide for a while for few weeks at least.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 11:46:42'] Inverse Cramer. I’m in
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 13:15:41'] What are the rules now? This is tagged as a meme so does positions or ban no longer apply?Postions or ban.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 14:52:20'] Did he not tweet he was ready to buy amazon and apple this morning when people sell?
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 16:22:28'] I'm going to laugh when some real leaders get into office and decide to start breaking up some of these companies so our free market has competition again.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 12:46:13'] Maybe he has finally learnt to inverse himself before speaking. Staying away from AMZN for now makes sense.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 14:52:33'] I think peak Amazon is over. I think it'll be flat for years because retail caught up with the whole free shipping or store pickup thing. Unless web services grows a shit ton.Just like Netflix, they're no longer the only game in town. However, yes inverse Jim.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 16:41:31'] I just recently finished an amazon warehouse and am aware of how many additional facilities amazon will be opening in the next 2 years that are already paid for and financed, and will sit unused for 2-5 years before even being used. I'm long on amazon. They have so much money they don't know what to do with it, so will begin buying back shares. Anyone who thinks the results just released are a sign that amazon is floundering, is an idiot.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 12:50:14'] There will be a point when Cramer is gonna inverse himself

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 17:09:20'] I feel like most the posts these days are just about inversing Cramer and laughing at Cathie
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 01:27:14'] The losses reported by Ford and Amazon on Rivian are so misleading.  Amazon will be fine.Amazon invested 700M.   Rivian IPO took that investment as high as $12.5B.Rivian crashing dropped it to "just" 3.5B.   Amazon reports a huge loss.&#x200B;Same story with Ford only 500M invested.  Reached as high as 7B and now only worth a couple bill.     Ridiculous how they got portrayed as these huge losses for either company.  These are absolutely tax maneuvers to make losses seem way higher than they really are.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 16:05:22'] Only one bright side is computing cloud. The rest of Amazon sectors are saturated and downsized market shares by rivals Target, Walmart…

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 17:44:10'] absolute madlad
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:59:43'] With great sadness towards his meme. Cramer is right about the price of amazon going lower. Probably to $1,800 a share.  That should invoke some crazy fear right there. Cramer is right about something!
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 20:04:10'] Does inverse Cramer take priority over inverse WSB though??? Everyone buying calls
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 20:04:48'] I been buying amazon as well best thing in market right now
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 20:23:19'] Haha I literally just loaded up buying the dip. The unbeknownst inadvertent inverse cramer karma has me creaming my jeans
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 21:33:30'] I am thinking buy it at $2300.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 21:53:55'] my work sells so much crap through Amazon Seller its insane. Most of our sales team left, don't need them when 50k a week is selling itself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 23:37:07'] If Kramer says “it ain’t gonna suck itself” does it, in fact, suck itself?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 04:20:09'] Amazon’s glory days are gone. Too much competition on all fronts, in my opinion.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 04:54:49'] Your probley better off avoiding anything that comes put of cramers mouth. Except gme.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 07:46:28'] I bought two shares beginning of the week. It’s been a rough one lol
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 08:10:45'] It coming down gave me the opportunity to go ahead and buy 5 shares of it.  I only wanted 5 for the 20:1 split coming up.  It will be one of those long term investments ill put to the side and check on it in about 5 years.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 09:17:35'] Someone really needs to make an inverse Cramer fund.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 11:03:38'] Jim Cramer is truly a moron

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 13:06:16'] Amazon is very close to a monopoly. They have alot to lose and not much to gain in their position, that's why I do not see much potential anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-29 11:56:39'] There’s some inborn reasoning that sectors can’t do well unless the entire market is performing. Well if everyone is looking for the exact same breadth thrust indicators they’re likely not going to work. Literally everyone is expecting the market to correct because it’s top heavy. Nobody can make sense of it so it keeps working. Welcome to markets.

It might not be priced into the stock,  but it's for sure going to be priced in the options.  I think AMZN will crash if he does,  but I don't think it will go up if the flight is successful.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 13:54:27'] I think a strangle on $SPCE is a better application of your logic here: * $AMZN isn't directly affected by success or failure here, especially since Bezos stepped down as CEO. I think you're less likely to see a huge valuation drop than maybe a little blip if he goes boom, but it would likely be short lived. * Blue Origin has a much better track record and engineering design than Virgin Galactic - no failures in like a dozen tests vs. several failures in like 3 tests for VG, including a fatality. New Shepard is an autonomous vehicle, Spaceship 2 needs to be hand flown by the pilot, which introduces a lot of room for error as seen by the fatal flight. * $SPCE is going to have insane volatility one way or another - I think the biggest concern is picking an expiry that factors in potential launch delays, which would probably result in a slight dip but not a crash. I'm going to be opening a 7/16 strangle on $SPCE (probably like 35p/60c) on Friday with a target movement of about 50% in the underlying. Best of luck to you and your degenerate bets 🍻

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 22:05:03'] I would maybe splurge on July 30th puts, more time for the stock price would just have to move in your direction by a few hundred dollars for your FD to be profitable.  You benefit from the news about the event, but also Amazon's future, also recovery of remains, maybe funeral, etc.Sadly for you, I think the launch will be pretty safe and little risk, but who knows... maybe China has some space shenanigans planned.  So could be a sleeper bet.   What result would benefit China, I'm not really paying attention with that angle.  Amazon seems to be a good customer for their products.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 22:10:25'] this is basically the strategy of Cornwall Capital (In the Big Short they were renamed Brownfield Capital)Their strategy was essentially putting bets on unlikely things to happen. You lose a little when it doesn't happen but you make a fuckton when it does.A 25% dip isn't out of the question if on the very unlikely chance that the launch goes sideways Shit, puts for $2070 are going for $1 a contract. People have thrown away $100 on more than one roulette spin before and the pay off here is better than 35:1

You get bonus exposure to heart attack post launch if it does go ahead on the 20th
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-28 22:53:20'] So I started checking the chain out. I dunno now man. Let’s say you go a ways out to get outs for .01. So that would be 2080 puts, bro... I dunno. I guess I’m missing something, is this a big bet for you, and how far otm are the puts you’re looking at?

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-29 00:27:36'] The funniest thing about this is there's going to be a fuckload of people crossing their fingers hoping that the ship explodes and people will be like "why are you cheering" and then they'll be all like "cuz I'm fucking rich"

But we concluded that even if Bezos doesn't come back it won't effect Amazon as much as we originally thought. Maybe a one or two day shock drop but I doubt it will be greater than 10% Bezos has less influence on Amazon now a days..vs.... Tesla Elon Musk if he went poof I think Tesla would have far greater drop ! Just my opinion!

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 10:11:49'] If they announce a stock split, which they should and maybe will with Bezos more distanced, it'll be a win for sure.I'm dick deep in AMZN since just before the run to 3k, so like, it's not been a bad investment but this year and a bit has been dreadful watching it go sideways missing the trend.Without remembering or bothering to lookup previous earnings and estimates, as we do, I bet analysts were a little ahead of themselves due to growth from starting covid. Amzn will near miss top line estimates, blow out bottom line, and guidance probably at or slightly below analyst.I should probably actually listen to this call as Jassy should be defining himself now.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 09:46:00'] I think AMZN bears have a point, they are exposed to fuel costs and trucking costs in a big way, and those have continued to go up. And they did peak during the pandemic, and we know that a lot of companies that did lost that ground as pandemic cooled off, at the same time, what amazon offers is so essential it's hard to say how it's going to play out. I said it before, but I think AMZN is the darkhorse of this ER season, every reasonable cell in my body is telling me to stay out of this one.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 19:04:29'] Question for u/john151     Are you going to sell at open tomorrow or hold for a few hours and see if it continues going upward?      I bought 3K worth of options, expiring tomorrow, halfway during the day today, with strike prices between 3300 and 3500. IV will eat them up but I’m greedy and want to see how it begins to rip up on market open before I pull the cord.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-03 09:35:35'] Alibaba, which grows faster than AMZN, had meh ER last quarter. I don't think AMZN is any way better. The economy is slowing down. Look at the Chinese HSI for the past year. That's SP500\\NASDAQ this year. Don't buy anything just yet, there is no rally ahead until the rate hike and end of tapering.

POST_TEXT: b"Amazon earning are in 2 days. I am buying puts and here's why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) **Amazon-owned Twitch recently started taking more money from creator revenues** (Source:  [A Letter from Twitch President Dan Clancy on Subscription Revenue Shares | Twitch Blog](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2022/09/21/a-letter-from-twitch-president-dan-clancy-on-subscription-revenue-shares/) ) The days of being alive and unprofitable are over, and the numbers need to start looking better. This reminds me of when $NFLX raised their prices right before a historically terrible earnings call. I am expecting something similar this time as well. I think its simple that amazon needs more money and is cracking down on twitch to boost their numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) **Out of the blue Prime Day 2** (technically called Prime Early Access Sales but I call it prime day 2) Trying to get rid of excess inventory? Trying to pad sales numbers? I am not sure but it doesn't look good to me.  Data suggests lighter sales than Prime "
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 10:03:08'] If you think point 1 is a big reason and point 3 and 4 are small reasons then you're saying twitch booties are the center of the economy. FYI just because you watch twitch thots, doesnt mean that that's the biggest part of amazon's business model
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 09:57:03'] that's a pretty good play for a gamble. down move would probably go below $112.
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 09:54:19'] Got it, buy calls!
	COMMENT: ['2022-10-26 08:37:09'] >I think you're right about all of this. I would also add that Amazon's margins have been declining for years, and they are now at a point where further declines will start to eat into their profits. This is not a good sign for the company, and I believe it is one of the reasons why their stock has been underperforming lately.

That's more than double Walmart and Amazon together, or like Walmart plus Amazon plus Apple plus Volkswagen plus CVS plus UnitedHealth.

	COMMENT: ['2022-12-08 23:24:52'] >I think that AMZN is a good stock to buy right now. The market looks like it is starting to rebound, and AMZN has held up well so far. I believe that the $91 level will be broken soon, and the stock will continue to rise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-08-25 23:03:10'] In other news, just to make sure there is equitable coverage, Chancellor McCormick ruled today that Musk's data requests were "absurdly broad" and "no one in their right mind" would entertain them. Twitter has to hand over bot account data for the 9000 accounts they used to create their 10-K earlier this year - everything else is denied. This is a relative MASSIVE W for Twitter.Musk's case can effectively no longer rely on the big scary bot problem.There were two other discovery disputes ruled on today as well - both of them were wins for Twitter. Musk must now provide Twitter access to the data scientists that Musk used to determine reasons for exiting the deal.

Covid was hitting, so I ran weekly spy puts 3 weeks in a row and I was back at 20k. Dumped almost all of into into long JNUG calls and stock. Sold in the fall and was sitting at around 130k.I've never managed to replicate that. Took a break and came back in February. Current biggest position is down 70%.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 20:17:12'] OP if you’re seeing my comments, another one I have to say is, isn’t it crazy these people are shocked about 200K at 26? If you worked at 16 making 90K a year on average for 10 years that’s 900K take out taxes and use the money you have for fun to invest it all and even after all this time you’ve made more money and accomplished more then they have. Sad people really. If you think this is seriously gambling then yea be safe but there is a reason you got into it, if you think you have talent maybe play a bit longer and deep dive, figure out what you really think things will do, not just gambling. If you can do that you could grow it even more. Be safe and stay true to yourself. I’m 19 bruh I blown up crazy amounts but I’ve made lots too. Down rn but we on our way back up.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 11:14:51'] So you essentially about doubled your original balance?.. $217k > $490k (pending your taxes).. that was a hell of a lot of work and stress for a 2 bagger, lol.. congrats on the rebound but I would transfer out that initial $200k+ so you aren't tempted to make another major mistake and play with the house $$$... you got extremely lucky numerous times crawling back and those streaks are nearly impossible to replicate going forward.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 11:38:04'] Straight up gambling. Which means over time, if he keeps gambling, he'll loose it all since it's based on luck.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 03:54:47'] It could go lower and then you'll be further from affording that car. May isn't for a while, so you should save money responsibly. See if you have any old stuff lying around that you can sell on eBay. I've made $700 just this month selling clothes I don't wear anymore--and a lot of that was old worn-in carhartt stuff that for some reason kids will pay an arm and a leg for... Like 2x what I paid I'm not exaggerating. You might have some valuable stuff and not even know it.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:12:31'] >Why would you do that? You're just encouraging her to be lazy and not work for what she wants. If she really wanted the car, she would find a way to get the money herself.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:18:33'] Both are attractive stocks at the moment but you need to know when to get out before the big recession next year.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:41:08'] I really don't want to sound like a dick at all. But you really shouldn't be investing if you're asking for stock picks on Reddit. What is the moat, FCF, margins, buybacks, growth-potential, macro-economic/geopolitical risks, what are the legal risks of eg Google analytics being banned, what impact will it have on its business. Can you make that assessment in the Reddit comment-section ? Sir you have a daughter so I assume you're older but I'm 24 and self taught so you should be able to do this yourself as I'm in no way a smart person. Congrats on your daughters birthday in may. She has a generous dad and that's awesome.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:34:02'] Both have recently hit abyssal lows .... I think GOOGL historically so. So in theory they have nowhere to go but up. Though, in reality, there's still a lot more down they could go instead. Welcome to stocks.
	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 02:52:21'] No to both, bcuz GME outperfomed them BOTH this year..

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-04 04:24:50'] That's about $400 a month to save up to $2800. Tell her to get a job to save $200 a month and you'll match her.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 08:55:05'] This was the right play. Even making hedge would be stupid yesterday. GOOGL showed insane profits and went up by 6%.Most everyone would have thought that AMZN would go up more than down. And def not expect a 7% drop. I would have bought AMZN calls too because I was 100% sure it was gonna gain but doing so math, I thought a 2-3% gain was gonna be only 100% gain due to IV so didn’t bother the risk. If this had gone your way- you’d be making bank. (Imagine a 7% gain!) mad respect for you on sharing the loss.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 12:36:14'] These are the YOLO's I want to see here. Not those "I bought shares, so I just lost a few hundred bucks on my yOlO"  My advise: around 03:00 there is less competition for giving BJ's behind Wendy. If you suck at it hard enough, you might recover for the next month YOLO on gourds.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-30 09:17:08'] You need to hope the Delta Variant is real so people start picking up more online orders. Being heavily involved in the ECommerce realm I can assure you AMZN, UPS, FDX have all experienced drastic dips in volume over the past month and volumes continue to slide south… which will directly correlate to revenues/profits in a negative light.

POST_TEXT: b'As the title says, AMZN is gonna do a historic 20-for-1 split and its finally coming. I want to be part of history. I think this is bullish despite the mess the market is currently in. A bear market rally is over due as well. This could align the stars to make AMZN a good swing trade until after the split.\n\nSo when is it exactly?\n\nhttps://investorplace.com/2022/03/when-is-the-amazon-stock-split-date-what-will-happen-to-amzn-stock/\n\n> The first will be May 27, 2022, which will serve as the record date. That means if you want to participate in the stock split, you must own AMZN stock by May 27. Individual accounts will start to update to reflect the stock split by June 3, 2022. Finally, AMZN will start trading on what is called a split-adjusted basis by June 6, 2022. That is when investors will start to notice the lower share price.\n\nI\'m pretty sure there\'s gonna be plenty of confusion about the record date and the "must own" phrasing of the above text, but this date doesn\'t really matte'

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 04:42:43'] Stock splits are bullish in bull markets because lots of stupid money is chasing - are we still in one?Stock splits are neutral in bear markets - because stupid money is getting decimated.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-26 09:38:25'] Splits are of course meaningless and don't change anything about the business, valuation etc. It is to attract retail. It's like going into a store because it says SALE with 20% off tags on everything even though the goods have the every day normal 233% markup.

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-05 07:55:46'] I am all in on this I agree we are truly due for the rally and AMZN  is a well run ( 100 Companies in one )  . I read a blog that compared AMAZON  to being the Berkshire Hathaway of the future  . I agree  you see so they hit a bad retail quarter that was slightly worse of what people thought on high expetations . Well every company  did on the stay home situation going away .  I personally get  4 deliveries a week  saving me time , fuel , and best of all  the best prices out there .  This is where people will shop in a recession and also in good times . AMZN is the KING OF RETAIL  and always will be .  Take a look at the long list of companies they are growing into profit farms it is truly amazing .   This will be a huge FOMO event at prices  as low as this  and we could double our investment in a short period. This will split at  $122.50 and  then  by 2024 -25  be well over  $4000  again possible for even  higher . I bought  Bershire Hataway years ago for the same reason  and plan on Amazon giving me even better returns .  Thank you

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-25 13:18:18'] If hedge funds are invested in amzn and if they have to liquidate their assets during the flush, at the current price, does this make amzn more of a clever trap? The reason being is that retail will get access to their split shares after the big institutions have received their split and tanked the price. And not only that. After the split has occurred. Hedge funds could short amzn to take advantage of retail selling their shares after them. I think puts on amzn seem better.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-02 11:32:41'] TLDR is: -Discover investing/wsb in March 2020. -Catch the wave of volatility and go up to 80k playing ridiculous priced TSLA, AMZN, and SPY options at the time.-Think I’m a grand wizard of investing and decide that ~400% returns in a few months isn’t enough. Time to get rich or die tryin. -Take a couple big hits in summer 2020. Fucked my mental. Chase it ever since -Life in shambles

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 16:34:20'] I have a similar record, but started following this brilliant guide recently:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12jq4jf/its\_just\_math/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12jq4jf/its_just_math/)Currently 33 profitable options trades in a row (mostly scalps), 300% gains in 2 weeks. I only need to make like 100 profitable trades more to break even. Assuming I go all in every time. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) I don't really expect this to work, but it's a lot more fun this way.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-01 19:05:13'] I bonds have a solid fixed rate of 0.9% now.  The overall rate is only 4.3% since inflation is slowly waning, but that fixed rate is fairly solid.  Can likely find some better municipal government bonds but depends on what you think inflation and interest rates will do long-term compared to how much you think we'll have a recession.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-11 11:30:17'] >1) I think that the most important thing for people to remember when investing is to always stay disciplined and not get emotional. This can be difficult at times, but it is crucial in order to make sound investment decisions.2) Another important factor to consider when investing is diversification. Diversifying one's portfolio across different asset classes and industries can help mitigate risk and improve returns over time.3) Finally, it is also important to have a clear understanding of your goals before making any investments. What are you trying to achieve with your investments? Are you looking for short-term gains or long-term growth? Once you know your goals, you can better align your investment strategy accordingly.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 05:36:59'] That's a lot of words to say: market movements are based on human feelings, and not on facts. Crypto just went up 10% after the Fed announcement. So yeah, nobody knows shit about fuck (unless insider info).

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 09:16:36'] Amazon is pushing automation hard.The new system I saw in Seattle basically requires half the people for the same amount of work.The Automation is expensive though. And will take time. It's only expected like 12 of the 200+ logistics sites will have the new automation but they expect 200 to be finished by end of 2023. So Amazon is going balls deep on investment.This automation also does this, you can instead of fire half the workers keep them but increase output.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 08:24:11'] I believe the main reason they missed target is because of the loss they took on Rivian Investment. The inventory increase is part of supply chain cycles typically after a shortage. You can see a significant increase in inventory that would affect cash flow. Amazons financials look solid compared to industry
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-29 09:06:20'] Nobody gives a fuck about single period net income. They went up because strong guidance and aws.

Every tom, dick, and Harry in trucking or big farming operations was contracting fuel as far out as they could a year ago by the tanker load even if they had to increase their line of credit to do it.Edit: I forget that they contract a lot of freight so forget everything I just said, I'm a moron.

Amazon is one of the few mega caps with really stretched P/E ratio and a long way to fall if they can't demonstrate growth that justifies it.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 18:18:36'] Went to Home Depot and Lowe's yesterday. Thought it was a week to Christmas.
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 18:01:49'] I want to add to this: notice all the christmas decorations out in frikin august?  I thought it was just some weird costa rica thing but it looks like it was in a few countries, too many goods to sell, not enough buying.  Another good economic indicator is the canadian tire flyer, when the economy is strong, things arent on sale as much, and not a high percentage, but when the economy is weak, good items are half off, sixty even seventy percent off
	COMMENT: ['2022-09-29 17:50:31'] They did move Christmas up early this year. It’s not just AMZN though with the decorations. I think the EU is going after AMZN for sanctions on Prime. Haven’t heard much about their cloud business side.

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 15:25:38'] Google “mortgage”, buy your home with 20% down, put the remainder into $AMZN and $GOOG seeing how they helped you learn about mortgages.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 21:10:33'] These are shares though
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 21:18:55'] This is satire right…

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-31 09:32:31'] AMZN at $3295. Shoulda waited
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-31 10:46:06'] Give me your money. This is atrocious.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 20:29:31'] Still holding??
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-24 20:37:29'] Kind of impressive you almost bought at the top
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 15:24:28'] This is tricky because AMZN is rated as “underperform” due to various impact points converging in the next few months. However, it’s Amazon and can plow through all the loss in one weekly swing. Try getting to 100 shares slowly and sell covered calls.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 18:57:38'] JFC how lame WSB has become. how in the fuck amzn shares a YOLO? OP are you high on fenty? Go back to r/investing . DUMBASS

	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 18:56:42'] Shares though? Amzn would have to go up so much
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 19:05:21'] Honestly you should’ve waited 1 or 2 weeks. It’s on a downtrend and should reach 3100-3200 before going up again. Also earnings going to be interesting so they don’t have Rivian profit to prop up the stock. You should have at least put in 1/4 and have 3/4 to buy dips. Good luck.
	COMMENT: ['2022-03-30 19:28:51'] I like it!  I started buying when they announced the split.  Hoping for $4000 prior to split.

	COMMENT: ['2022-11-30 08:18:49'] Everyone uses Amazon nowadays. It’s a consumer staple. High gas prices. Who wants to drive to a store and battle people on the road and in the stores. Much easier to just click and place and order online.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 16:45:39'] I’ll never understand you guys that keep trying to short the entire market the year *after* a -25% decline.The time to buy puts was 18 months ago when the Fed started telegraphing their rate hikes. All of the negative economic doom and gloom going on right now has been predicted for almost two years now. That’s why such a sharp decline happened *before* any actual negative economic indicators started showing up.It. Is. Priced. In.EDIT: for those who don’t understand, think about it this way…99% of wsb being bearish and buying puts does nothing to lower stock prices. The *only* thing that lowers stock prices is sell orders overpowering buy orders. When talking about SPY, that means institutions and wealthy boomers panicking.It’s one thing to short an individual stock. With SPY, the baseline is billions of new dollars being pumped into the market every week via 401k contributions alone. It takes some actual unexpected economic news to outweigh that and we’re still 12% off all time highs.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-18 17:33:46'] Expect you're gonna have a bad time here bud. Market will provide greater clarity over the next week, but - with this breakout - I wouldn't be shocked if we end up going on an actual run until ~July 25th or so.After which, once everyone's re-convinced we're blasting off back into a full-blown bull and bought the top to institutional capital unloading, we then begin a slow (into eventually rapid) descent and collapse into actual recession sometime in 2024.Edit: Market's gotta spend some time looking super irrational (continual upwards movement) before a real chance at collapse, is what I'm largely convinced of at the moment. But again, will have stronger expectations based on how we perform over the next weekHonestly, if today was rough - I'm expecting that you're going to be in a world of hurt come market open tomorrow.

POST_TEXT: b'\n\nWhy the recession seems to not be happening.. in most places.\n\nBasically, it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow. Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places. \n\nRight now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they dont keep up with AI, wont make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasnt broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \n\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will '

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-07 13:19:02'] Nicely done. I was way more cautious on PACW with CSP/CC so have had smaller gains but also didn't do as badly on those 30% dump days.

POST_TEXT: b'Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, '

	COMMENT: ['2023-06-13 13:33:21'] **$ORCL earnings play (post mortem)**  Lots of ways to win on this one. Always easier in hinesight. **Pre-ER Straddle/Strangle**  Looks like if you purchased an $ORCL strangle/straddle prior to the recent run out that would have printed. If you bought yesterday, who ever sold you those call options did a little bit of a happy dance today.  Looks like $ORCL held $120-$121 for a little bit, enough time to sell those call options. If you went with the C110, which last Thursday was at the money, that would have went from $2 -> $12 (selling at 9:45AM). If you did that in a reasonable straddle or strangle, you costs to enter the position would have been about $6. That would return about +100%. **Post-ER Scalping (1 Trade)**If you were in a post-ER scalping mood, you would have picked up the $118 PUT around 10AM, and rode that like the 1 trick pony it was all day long. 10AM price about $1. 4PM price about $2.45. Which would have been a nice +136% for relatively little work.  **Post-ER Scaling (3 Trades)**  If you were in a post-ER day scalping day trade mood, you would have picked it up through some of the drop offs, get caught in a few minor spikes, but ultimately be a winner on the day. (+14%).  Trade 1: 10:18 -> 12:43 (P118 -- +24%)  Trade 2: 13:19 -> 14:15 (C120) -- -34%)  Trade 3: 14:45 -> 15:52 (P118 -- +24%)

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 18:05:11'] $CLNE and $BB are the only stocks i have feelings for. Feels good owning these companies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 18:45:02'] So basically.... what your saying is..... we have a very limited window to get something cheaper than Amazon gets it....CLNE stock.HA! Fuck you Bezos. I'll take whatever small victory I can get.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 17:21:14'] Wow finally a thoughtful post. Thank you so much for this contribution. CLNE is destined for greatness, unfortunately many here are short sighted. Buy, hold, get rich. I believe CLNE is going to make us a lot of money in the short term and the long term!
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 17:25:43'] All those words and no emojis. I’m tired now. Already fully loaded on $CLNE, so thank you for confirmation bias.Seriously though, it seems like CLNE will be in a spot in the very near future (if they aren’t there already) that they basically sell every drop of RNG they can possibly produce. Everybody wants it for those sweet carbon offsets and CLNE is one of the big boys in the industry. I think RNG is gonna have a parabolic type of adoption curve in the next 5-10 years while other companies try to figure out more electric stuff (solid state batteries, cleaner lithium mining, etc.).

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 18:13:29'] Let me redo this TL:DR. Amazon bought CLNE at $13.49, expecting it to go way above this value. Stock is $11.20 now, so that's a 20% increase just to match the $13.49. This is a strong buy!!

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 19:12:24'] CLNE has so much potential & hope to win. That's why I put my entire portfolio in it. There are so many stocks you think those are good but at the end they turn against you to lose. but not CLNE. If you bought the dip, you made it.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 19:49:03'] I have been into CLNE for a while. I honestly didn't read any of the post. CLNE is a well run company that seems to be cornering the entire RNG market. They are also massively shorted @ $13 June 18th. Great long and short term play. Especially if it hits anything about $13 by the end of market on the 18th.
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 17:52:49'] So what PT do you have for this by the end of 2022 if Amazon does start forcing other corporations to use RNG?

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 01:20:55'] Most of the news lately tried to demolish the bull thesis saying that Total is unloading shares heavily... On seeking Alpha they also wrote a wrong headline saying that Total sold 10 million share, while the count as of 08/06 should be 6.4 million.  Total needs to [finance the JV](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005231/en/Clean-Energy-and-Total-Sign-Joint-Venture-to-Develop-Carbon-Negative-Fuel-and-Infrastructure) with $CLNE, whose budget can be considered expensive for an oil major too:  *"The initial firm commitment is $100 million and can increase to $400 million as development opportunities progress. Since Clean Energy and Total will be providing the equity portion of the investments, the actual amount of capital invested in RNG projects may be higher than $400 million depending on the amount of leverage that is deployed. In addition, Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure."*Why cash is so important for RNG projects? It is important because in order to win the assignation of RNG projects (whose scale is increasing over time) you need to be the highest bidder. Many are competing to get these lucrative projects (Chevron, $ENB, single small companies previously active only in the ethanol segments)What $CLNE has that others have not is the distribution network...and look what Chevron is doing: [Chevron brands its first CNG retail site](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brands-its-first-cng-retail-site) *"Chevron U.S.A. Inc. announced the Allied Clean Fuels Plaza retail station in Napa, California, has been rebranded as its first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) site. Chevron expects to rebrand or open more than 30 CNG sites by 2025."*

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 18:19:05'] I didn't know this but it makes sense. That's probably why price targets are at least double what it was trading last week. I figure if amazon backs the horse it has to be a winner because Amazon loves money.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-15 01:16:01'] whatever happens with Amazon (which is clearly good news) $CLNE is an up and coming green sector company which has a real edge over the EV truck manufacturers - the CLNE product works - current trucks can be easily retrofitted for RNG, RNG refueling takes minutes compared to hours to recharge an EV truck, EV batteries weigh too much to be viable in long distance lorries hauling large loads and take up too much space, the green sector will be THE sector over the next 10-20 years

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 18:00:47'] While i certainly agree with the DD and will buy more CLNE in the morning, I'm not sure the floor for Amazon matters. Sure they want to sell the securities for more than their cost, but if they don't it's a tax write off, and the greenwashing campaign is where the real value is for Amazon. Not saying they want to sell at $7 a share, but the benefit they receive from Carbon-Neutral greenwashing is worth a loss for them. Nevermind, $30 EOW 🚀🌙🚀🌙🛸🧨

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 21:49:01'] I am selling my CLNE first thing. Thx
	COMMENT: ['2021-06-14 20:02:25'] While I'm a complete newbie on the stocks and investing side of things, I do have some expertise in low carbon alternatives. There is a huge cloud for this in the medium/long term. It's a great short term play to move towards carbon neutrality but there are far better (and cheaper) solutions on the horizon. Pretty much every diesel truck manufacturer knows the days of diesel are numbered. Cummins is throwing $1B at fuel cell development.  Even CLNE pays lip service to it on their web site talking about using their product to  make hydrogen or electricity...It's highly unlikely they'd be competitive with other technologies to make either.   While Jeff probably won't give Elon an order for Tesla semis virtually every other truck manufacturer is also working to develop them and as soon as they reach cost parity, it's game over for diesels, it won't matter what fuel they're burning... Once they're here the switch will happen and fast... Logistics managers will sell their mothers to save 2 cents a hundred weight... At that point  RNG loses a lot of it's advantages...  While CLNE  talks about RNG being used to make electricity, unless they can undercut historically low natural gas prices and make a profit,  that's a nonstarter.  Bloomberg is already predicting as much as $35B in gas fired power plants as stranded assets by 2030 unable to compete with cheaper renewables (and that's even factoring in cheap NG)  so if they're closing who are they going to sell the RNG to to make electricity from it? Same is true for hydrogen... While today the dominant source of H2 is reforming methane unless you can undercut the H2 from electrolysis of water from surplus solar  you're going to be in the same boat.. They're probably safe for the next two years... after that... hard to tell...

POST_TEXT: b"Big warning for AMZN bulls: AMZN has to markdown their losses w/ RIVN. Last quarter they added an $11.8b gain due to RIVN's IPO, which is why they had such a large EPS beat. This quarter will be very different due to the markdown. See quote from their ER last quarter:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November.[Sauce](https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/business_and_financial_update.pdf)\n\nWill the street ignore their negative EPS and focus on AWS growth? My assumption is EPS will miss, primarily due to the markdown - however if AWS growth is flat or also declines, AMZN's in for a huge red day.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Last quarter EPS: $27.25 actual vs $3.88 estimate. Why the mass disparity? RIVN. I'm very curious to see how the math looks tomorrow."

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 15:16:42'] That’s my main reason for being reluctant to play Amazon earnings. The Rivian IPO inflated their EPS last quarter. The company won’t have that crutch this time.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 15:38:20'] I feel like EPS will miss. Andy was hinting at it about a month ago. Supply chain issues and inflation worries are worse than last quarter. This concern might continue for another quarter.I'm also a little concerned about AWS growth being an issue. If MSFT (or others) eat into AWS revenue/growth, then AMZN might drop quite a bit.The caveat to that would be, for those who have cash and want to do some boomer investing, then maybe think about buying the AMZN dip.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-28 02:40:50'] the market certainly didn't not price that in

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 20:28:43'] Counter point is rsi is oversold, but I am super bearish 2340.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 23:25:28'] Should not be a major deal. Might move the stock short-term but irrelevant long-term. As to AWS, I think Google and Microsoft all had strong cloud growth so would assume that remains the narrative for Amazon.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 23:31:56'] IDk about this. I got a cousin that works at amazon and he says they are constantly looking for more workers to hire and they just expanded into my city and built more shipping hubs just recently. But knowing wall street they might drop AMZN just to shake the market.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 15:31:21'] r/union will kill Amazon. I might get in if AWS is spinned off.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-27 16:21:06'] Amazon operating income will be down 52% to 34.3B.  Net sales will be down 2% to 105.9B.Oddly specific ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)

	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 15:51:00'] Well bought 4 2100 puts. Should be a selling pressure if market turns bearish. Amzn was not in 2000 because of the split. Or with the guidance, and ER it should be on the 1800 range. Loosing money on e-commerce with over staffed , rising gas price biting hard. Prime delivery turning to a money loosing machine.  Over staffed as fuck and that why retail ceo resigned. Only positive is AWS and I don’t think we will see the same growth in clouds with increasing costs these days.

I called it in and decided to sell when they told me the fix won't happen until overnight.  I will update on the 80 x $130C 6/24/2022 later in the week. Cheers!
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-03 13:18:59']  I feel like Amzn has had alot of hold outs that's kept from selling waiting for this split hoping for a tsla/apple run. Otherwise I think Amazon would be alot lower. It's ER and forecast were horrible and it's p/e has yet to properly reflect that. If it does pop I'm definitely buying puts
	COMMENT: ['2022-06-04 06:28:23'] You're about 4 days too late. The "action" on it already happened .. like AMZN being up something like 10% this week including a 6% day a few days ago.The run up on the split already happened. Buy the rumor, sell the news. Unfortunately you bought the news...

It has a specific "node ID" in it. https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23376591011\n\nUpon reviewing what this means, a node ID is set up for a specific category of product.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-28 08:59:43'] Wonder if this could have even more upside for $AFRM's non-prime partner, which gets funneled from $AFRM its non-prime customers... seems like there could be a lot of convexity with the low market cap, low float (due to SPAC / seller lockups), and solid short interest.

	COMMENT: ['2022-07-28 12:03:17'] I don't have a position, but it feels like earnings could send the stock +5% to -20%. If you're a degenerate gambler, puts seem like the play over calls. I don't see how $AMZN avoids the inventory disaster Walmart is experiencing. Maybe cloud better than expected cloud growth could send it higher if you're looking for a hail mary?

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 06:50:20'] GME is the way🚀
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:34:16'] It all depends on how long you want to hold. The splits are good, but if you are not long to realize the full value: quantum work GOOGL is doing and their cloud biz;  TSLA with autonomous-taxi and AI assist personal robots;  AMZN full warehouse automation, etc., and for course AWS is a monster revenue stream and will continue to multiple.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 10:35:05'] Tesla still has to approve that split through the board , and that won’t be for a while. So, you might be to jump into two of those plays at separate times.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 07:44:03'] I'd go with Google first. They're involved in multiple companies from youtube/youtube tv, waze and they just bought a cyber security firm also. Tesla would be my second because they're the premier Electric Vehicle company and I just don't see their stake in the EV market going down that much.Amazon would be last, from what I read, they have some issues.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 07:50:55'] TSLA and GOOGL. …..and porn
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:57:24'] If you can afford all 3, split your profile to suit all 3.  IF you have to take 1, take Amazon. Retail is slowly dying out and everytime the highstreet loses value, Amazon gains value. It's growth potential is still absolutely huge, it has virtually no competitors (and nobody is even trying to, in all honesty). The others both have competitors, that could somewhat displace them sometime in the future.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:10:38'] Usually a conventional split is bullish AF but does anyone else find it rather strange Tech giants are doing it in the same timeframe..
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 07:14:34'] correct me if im wrong please... but historically before every stock split the stock rallies then the split happens and the stock normally gets sold off and falls in price that was the case with apple at least then it traded sideways for months before it started to gain again with earnings etc.So why buy stock specially if you missed the initial run up like in teslas case why not just buy leaps when the stock splits and ride those for a year or two. For one they will be much cheaper since the price has been reduced and you will still make the same amount of money if not more since you can now afford to buy more calls or even shares at that point.Edit: I should clarify im not saying tesla shares are going to fall in price after the split but they will remain stagnant for a while or they could rocket as the stock would be much more affordable for young investors... but i think some of you are confused as to you making more money when the stock splits. Your one share is now 10 shares etc but your money does not change.. Its the same as you waiting for the stock to split and buying the same amount of shares at that price instead of jumping in when the stock is close to ATH
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 09:20:29'] Tesla. Anything that guy does is a great bet. Man's a genius. Except twitter.. he has  a higher chance of being banned from the platform than Jack Dorsey taking Freedom of Speech seriously. (Unless he buys more and has the controlling share)
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-05 08:01:06'] Fat stacks on AAPL GOOGLI love Tesla, even have one, but would be a fool to think that all the EVs coming from other car manufacturers won’t compete heavily / cut into sales. We’ll have to wait and see how good or bad these new EVs are

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-05 21:42:29'] I can tell immediately that OP has a very extremely dangerous gambling issue. Not only is he finding ways to get all this margin out per play using a “shitty UI” that can screw up his position planning. But he’s also buying way too many contracts for an account as small as his. Yes 1-2 million dollars is extremely small for 8000 contracts. Even my buddy who’s networth is closer to 40 million and is a 1% trader has not gone higher than 600 contracts with a month or so expiration. Although his long term stocks can make him a million a day just by holding he doesn’t go for bust on his portfolio. At 2 million dollars OP should literally throw this in dividend stocks and VOO and quit forever. You won. You got 2 million.

If you can match Mary’s donation we will send you a free t-shirt with beautiful font and Jesus face on it with rocket emojis to help with your tendies. Our T-shirts are like no other.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 15:43:59'] This is the downfall of so many addicts; the thoughts of "I'm down from my peak, I'll just get back to the peak again and then sell." "I'm down from break even now, I'll just get back to break even and then I'll sell." "I've lost almost everything, I'll just get back to $50K so I've still got *something* left" and so it goes until you lose your last dollar, blow your ancestors 40 years of hard work and savings, and probably put a bullet in your head. *This is a casino*. You cannot get good at *gambling*. You get *lucky*, that's it. At least you've only lost $20K. Sell this shit and invest in index funds and ETF's. Jesus bro, your account is hanging by a thread and you're one bad decision away from fucking your life up. Please be smart.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 09:47:38'] assuming a high correlation between those stocks, i'd guess the delta on those nvda and qqq options along with the short are enough to mostly hedge the stock, and the futures are doing way more than hedging. judging by today's drop you'll be able to ride this to valhalla. maybe don't do it again though.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-25 14:18:10'] My biggest suggestion is to add a beta-weighted delta column (balanced to SPY). This will help you see if you're overall long or short the market and how exposed you are to price risk.It looks like you're short SPY and NASDAQ futures as a hedge on your long stock positions? But I think you're way over hedging them so you're very short the market as a whole.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 04:17:11'] start buying bitcoin - seriously
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 05:30:52'] Yes, but it is unlikely considering your positions.I have dig myself out of -30% to like -3% last week and I belive this week I'm breaking even and will catch up with SPY. I probably don't belong here for saying this, but what worked for me was selling everything at one point and going 100% cash. After that I waited for buying opportunity. What I did was waited for one of the bigger drops and loaded on high quality stuff dragged down by the market - mostly healthcare(CI, UNH, CNC), but not only and sold again on the next rise. Companies that I woudn't mind holding anyways for longer, for as cheap as possible. Basically swing trading, only stocks, not a single option. Took the money at average 5% gain on position, but I got 2-3 positions at most with 80% invested so if I make 5% on each of the 3 positions is like 10-12% total portfolio gain. And this seems to be working - buy low sell high. Not having exp. date helps a lot to wait it out until it pops. Never traded hyped up stocks, never will.What do you expect from AMD at 95PE? What could reallisticly happen to that stock - five times more expensive than the average SPY company? Go to 150 PE? You are just gambling there, with extremely high chances of losing and very tiny chance of making insignificant profit. https://preview.redd.it/kluwylj0g9wa1.jpeg?width=1584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c00ef23b0efd9977be07fcaf388605a0154abab0
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-26 16:33:40'] Is it possible? Yes. Will you do it? Probably not. Go to a money market account or cd. I hope you know, even in an index fund you can suffer loss that makes you panic.

Here is my "based on financials view/opinion ".Right before this "pump" the CEO stated from magic pixie dust that NVDA's "forecasts it will earn $11 billion during the same period next year—up 50 percent from analyst estimates." Based on what? Crystal ball? AI? The homeless guy said it?  What regression technique forecasted that much? Also look at insider sales this month. Enjoy the ride!
	COMMENT: ['2023-06-17 00:55:41'] Cisco sells wires. Its stock price should always have tracked, and should always track, traffic. Nvidia sells components and software. It should track number of users imo.

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 15:56:07'] Wall street is funny.For 3 years, Disneys massive subscriber growth didn’t matter because they were losing money, so the street kills them So they increased the price and massively beat on eps (for +), but unsurprisingly lost subscribers, so the street kills them

	COMMENT: ['2023-05-10 14:19:42'] Sorry to see you’ve inversed your puts so far; although, I don’t think the earnings call is out yet?Looks like the market is pricing in Disney at its pre Disney + announcement in 2019 (stock was around 110ish I think), plus Covid hangover.  Disney has cannibalized its old cable subscribers or simply lost out as people have abandoned the format, and it continues to lose money overall in this area.

They are expected to lose millions this summer on that damn hotel. Then you got indy 5  that is massively over budget, google it.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 18:24:19'] If the stock can move after hours, I should be able to sell my options at the same time.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:12:21'] The price jumps when EPS beats analyst expectations.The price drops when people realized all their Year over Year metrics are worse than their Q1 2022 (when the price was about the same) and after that earnings call the price dropped.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:37:32'] Everything was going so well, until it wasn't..Topazeco woke up on this faithful morning to a normal bed and normal routine. Remembering that Amazon had earnings upcoming, he all but fumbled his way through a newly acquired stock market trick; *Options*. Armed with the knowledge of a million regards before him, he smiled as he put his wife's surgery savings all on puts, loudly exclaiming that "This definitely can't go tits-up".....well, reader.... something interesting happened....
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:28:44'] I believe that Amazon will continue to rise in value. I would recommend buying AMZN stock.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:40:32'] Thanks for the real advice and shit talking. Lessen learned, get with brokerage that does AH trading quickly, listen to earnings call, prime option, wait just long enough for good news, click button, prep sell, click button at first sign of bad news. ✔️
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:41:04'] You are letting your emotions block your reasons. Your emotions convince you to believe that they are working against you. The initial pump is from the good results of past. The dump followed is reaction to negative guidance going forward.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 18:42:40'] It was up initially because earnings report was better than expected. It then dipped because during the earnings call the CFO basically said AWS won’t be growing as quickly as it has for the unforeseeable future. AWS is the big long term money maker for Amazon. Retail is going to be a low margin business forever. So AWS/advertising are the most important to Amazon and when the CFO said that he basically said for the next x period it won’t be as good as it was. I think he specifically said single digit too which is a major bummer because they were growing in the 20%+ YoY for years
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 16:52:26'] I don’t know how seriously you’re asking but technology and competition between Robinhood, Webull, etc means that trades can get filled at wider and wider spans of the day. Trading at lower volume hours can be erratic if huge activity happens all of the sudden.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 17:07:54'] Up based on last quarter earnings, down on guidence.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 21:21:11'] This happened because a majority of investors are financially illiterate and take the words of news outlets at face-value
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 21:34:56'] Report came out, numbers good price go up, later on the call the future guidance was all doom and gloom, price go down. Simple.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-27 23:00:04'] Im not a financial advisor but probably because the green line went up and then it went back down again

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 10:34:23'] Long Nvidia. Short silver. Why silver? The price isn't allowed to go above $25 and change. The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all; https://www.bullionstar.us/blogs/ronan-manly/jp-morgan-gold-traders-contempt-for-the-law-plan-to-appeal-their-convictions/If anyone wants to know the second reason for keeping silver nailed down to 25 bucks, just ask. I'll lay it all out for you

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 21:47:21'] My take - Tesla and Meta don't belong on that list.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-16 23:56:05'] On a long view, TSMC is too big to survive.  Their position right now makes the tension over Taiwan far hottter, and now a systemic risk for every major economic power.If you've got a 10-15-year horizon, the market will resettle with them competing much closer to parity with several regional/national champions, fed by virtually limitless cash from Washington or Beijing or Brussels for security reasons.So I'd say short TSMC and long INTC.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-31 19:11:42'] Those contracts 🚀🚀💵💵.. I think Amazon is positioning itself for a split, maintain it’s over % holding, but giving the stock price and volume the fuel in this current market! It will definitely produce a better overall forecast for the next 12 months 💵💵🤔

	COMMENT: ['2020-06-02 15:49:59'] The thing is that these looters dont understand that even carrying their cell phones in during a crime could incriminate them in the all too immediate future. Also when residents complain the corner sign amd traffic lights have security cam...they take the cam down but keep the microphones on. And sound is really almost just as good as video. For example theres a math formula that relates jet noise acoustic profile to engine characteristics such as fan blade count and aerodynamic envelope that gives listeners an idea of the size and dimensions of the plane. "They" are definitely doing this w voice recognition. Hot mics will soon be on every street corner if they are not already.

	COMMENT: ['2021-10-15 16:48:02'] AMZN is like a index with its over blown stock price it goes down 500 points then goes up 100, probaly gives most of its owners heart attacks, which is why AAPL etc do stock splits, it attracts buyers and the few dollar up and downs are not a problem. This is probably why you sold, the wild swings then sideways, the other side of the coin is bad news AMZN shits the bed gapping down again by 400 points. I am never doing over night option plays, only intra day, all the moves happen pre and after market anyway, no one can predict those, fck that noise.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 13:27:23'] PE is only about half of what you need to look at when evaluating growth oriented companies.  You want to look at PEG ratios, which take into account not just the current value, but the growth rate.GOOG may have a PE of around 20, but it has a growth rate of \~27% annual.  Peter Lynch has used a simple metric of PE = growth rate to value companies (this method is close to using the PEG equation).The mega caps aren't over valued.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 14:10:03'] A low P/E is a good sign of stable growth without loading up on debt or diluted stock shares. AAPL has a P/E of 23, very good, and a Net Margin (Profit) of 27%. In contrast, TWTR has a P/E of 202 and Net Margin of 4.27%, meaning not keeping up with 8% inflation.    It is weird finding out Dorsey only held on to 2.5% shares. That means he never believed in the corporation and had been selling off controlling interest in shares the past 10 years. Dorsey is an example of a CEO selling off shares after IPO to finance the corporation.
	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 13:09:39'] I heard somewhere that if you are talking about PE ratio means you don't know what you talking about.

	COMMENT: ['2022-05-01 16:15:16'] Alphabet grows revenue 20% yoy for the last 20 years. Something tells me a 15 P/E is not the correct multiple for a one in a million company.

Since projected forward market returns over the next five years is 5%, these guys want your $$$$.

	COMMENT: ['2022-09-09 05:56:46'] Puts on Amazon at earnings. They changed the platform for their streaming service and it absolutely sucks. I don’t even watch tv much but my wife pays for 4 or 5 streaming services and she can’t stand Amazons new layout. This says a lot… she said she hates it and hasn’t been using Amazon as much since the change. Big mistake on Amazons part, I think they are going to loose subscribers.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-12 15:15:16'] Just wondering how you got a million dollars. If you got a million dollars unless you hit lottery than you can’t be dumb…As for CLOV , better stocks with more potential. AMZN will have trouble staying at this price as people return to “ normal” purchasing patterns, increase labor cost, shipping,  China’s supply chain issues, and stiff competition from everyone Walmart, Target. That’s my two cents.

Did get some profits out of scalping, but at this point I feel it's just gonna be death by a thousand cuts before my main position gets liquidated anyways isn't it, which will probably feel so much worse than it being liquidated by some actual bullish news.

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 16:33:28'] How could this have ended badly. You have a call credit spread with the short strike at $3,780. You need AMZN below that. AMZN peaked at $3,773. If you held to expiration, you ought to be fine. Did Rh close you early and mess your day up?
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 17:57:17'] I really don’t understand how this is a loss? This is the ideal result from a call credit spread and is therefore a win. What was the premium you pocketed? The only ways this was a realized loss is if you don’t understand spreads and closed your position before expiration or Amazon hit  between the strikes after hours and you got exercised on the short leg.
	COMMENT: ['2021-11-20 18:46:18'] How is this even a loss? Amzn closed below your strike on expiration. You only lost if you actually closed at a loss

POST_TEXT: b"**Why I bought $AMZN Calls for the Space Flight Tomorrow**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPretty no brainer trade tbh, only two scenarios can occur, both of which benefit Amazon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Scenario 1 : Successful Space Flight**\n\nThis is the most likely outcome. The flight is good, and $AMZN rallies cause people are stupid as hell and don't realize that Bezos has nothing to do with Amazon anymore.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:16:53'] Bezos still owns 10% of Amazon, biggest single shareholder.If the flight is successful, not much will happen.If it crashes Amazon will tank like hell.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:10:38'] If bezos dies wouldn't his shares just go wherever his will deems and eventually sold
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:17:32'] Do you not know how wills work?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:49:57'] It's going to go well and price is going to plummet anyway, you gambled based on logic and we know that just doesn't work
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:09:56'] It'll do great, just like SPCE.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 13:22:24'] Have you heard of this thing called a will? You think bezos wouldnt write one before yeeting into space?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 16:53:27'] Grade A fucking moron.  Scenario 2 is prime crayon eating.  How this guy has enough money to buy AMZN calls yet not know how estate planning works is just…I don’t even know.  There might not be a word for how stupid this is, so I’m going to make one up.  This is Bubble Brain.

You apparently qualify to post stuff. Good thing you did not answer yes to all three... Once a guy did so and we had to take him out back and shoot him on the spot, because he would have ruined the whole vibe we got going on here.

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 15:40:39'] May I remind you of what happened to SPCE
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 17:52:20'] I personally think the move is short term puts to hedge against the rocket blowing up and falling to earth faster than my Robinhood account with long term calls that you double down on if the stock tanks and you have an opportunity to buy the dip AMZN will recover in the long term its all about protecting those long term calls and buying the dip if it tanks I obviously have no money to make this play As always inverse every position I take because it will immediately move against me
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:33:07'] After seeing what happened to Dick Branson, I'll be buying puts

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 14:09:43'] You know people are stupid. If Bezos crashes, there will be an amzn fire sale.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 15:24:04'] You better buy some puts.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 15:50:23'] Because spce stock did so well after it’s flight

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 18:43:37'] Sounds like should inverse this for money... successfully flight stocks should go down look at spce as example.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 18:44:00'] And why would this be a good play if the flight is successful? I’m guessing you’re basing this off of how well SPCE did?

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 17:43:25'] This will have no impact on Amazon. I hope you went deep OTM 1 contract so at least you don’t lose too much.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 17:57:48'] how high is he going anyway?
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 18:51:27'] Already priced into the market buy puts✌️
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 19:02:19'] Anyone else get the Amazon updated terms of use tonight? The night before this space event. How disputes will now be settled through the courts instead of the arbitration process? May be old news but I just got the email and read through.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 19:21:39'] That is just wrong. When you die you don't lose your stock. It stays with your estate.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 19:27:14'] Remember what happened to $SPCE after their flight?Literally can’t go tits up 🥲

	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:07:09'] lol someone would inherit his shares. I bought Amazon put spreads myself as a lottery ticket.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:29:35'] Pretty sure his shares are not part of the float…
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:30:19'] Yeah great call, did you take that same approach with $SPCE? it tanked after the flight
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:38:22'] Or or or... consider this... it sells off anyway because sell the news.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:40:21'] Somebody is getting all of those shares, even selling 25% of them in a week is enough to drop the price
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 20:49:03'] I'm sure he has a will if he dies.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 21:25:13'] Truth
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 21:47:10'] By the hype, sell the news
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-19 22:30:03'] lmao it has nothing to do with AMZN. Bezo owns Blue Origins personally.I like this kid,lol
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-20 00:23:05'] Or the flight gets scrubbed 😂
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-20 00:31:59'] His kids would get the shares, right? Or some charitable trust or stupid shit like that.
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-20 00:34:01'] You forgot to account that it’s already priced in
	COMMENT: ['2021-07-20 01:17:14'] But Blue Origin isn't even part of AMZN.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-13 17:06:17'] Nicely done. I guess one could sell 2/3 and hold 1 longer, maybe even overnight. But with 1 DTE, I think you did the right thing. Lock in the nice gain for peace of mind and look for another opportunity, right?

POST_TEXT: b'$LMND reminds me of Amazon $AMZN in their early days  \n\n$LMND reminds me of Amazon $AMZN in their early days. Keeping Shorty Shadow aside Lemonade is disrupting a Trillion Dollar Market. Global Insurance is huge over one trillion for just AUTO INSURANCE. The problem or market has been solved by the same old legacy insurance providers like GEICO, State Farm, All State, Liberty Mutual on and on. These legacy providers have milked a market with little change for centuries which provides Lemonade $LMND the opportunity to disrupt at lightening speed with a digital platform AI, Machine Learnings that allows them to acquire new customers at 1/10th the cost of legacy providers. This same digital platform also allows $LMND to manage losses more efficiently thus delivering greater customer satisfaction. Let face it the dumb commercials on TV do nothing. This is what happens when you have no real difference in your offering. You run dumb TV commercials like that gecko of GEICO but what insurance '

Puts hard AF, doubling down based on this post alone
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 10:50:15'] Lemonade using independent agents to distribute because they couldn’t convince people insuring tbeir largest asset online is a good idea…
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 10:41:40'] I shopped Lemonade for insurance recently and they weren’t even remotely competitive with the other offers I received. Anecdotal, but not really inspiring personally.
	COMMENT: ['2022-07-11 13:21:50'] Lemonade has been around for a while, my view is if they were going to significantly disrupt the major players it would have happened already.

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 12:40:15'] Google all the way. I seriously think its earnings will double over the next few years. $3000 end of this week.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 11:57:02'] I predict Amazon will soar, simply because I bought puts. My thesis is that we see Amazon miss earnings as they lose share in the cloud computing space, and face higher labor and delivery costs on flattening sales during Q4. But every move I make is wrong so Amazon to $4k is probably more realistic.

Market sentiment is changing especially with the large cap stocks.Look at Netflix has come back over $100 share on the drop after earnings.  It was an over reaction due to a bearish forecast for the entire economy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-02-01 16:33:17'] Buying some OTM $SNAP calls and selling half before close, I expect a big move up as the app is still very popular among the younger crowd which is a goldmine for advertising space combined with the recent record breaking iPhone sales and this app still in the top 10 downloads on the App Store.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 11:59:23'] What is wrong with you, how are you smart enough to accumulate that much in cash yet dumb enough to do this?Nibba if you'd just invest that in even a risky stock index or two you'd compound a lot of money over time pretty reliably. You're probably going to lose all of this now.Edit: oh shit it's HyreDude you've gotta cut your losses and go. You made your money back, you were happy, just stop.Stop it. Get some help.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 12:43:54'] I LOL'ed when this was posted because it's an irrational bet without any supporting analysis.  However, once I came back from my piss break and saw the new comments I can't help but think maybe this bet might be just retarded enough to work so I told bought a put too.  And then just for kicks and giggles, I bought a 11/22 $SPY $307 put.  I should've gotten vaccinated before reading this post.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 15:23:09'] I think I cracked the karma code. My plays before were actually not retarded so I didn't get a lot of likes. This is clearly a shot in the dark and I am swimming in likes, thanks guys. Honestly this is what keeps me going.

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 13:16:34'] As an Amazon shareholder. I wish you well but this is the dumbest trade I’ve ever seen on here. Might as well just put that money into spy puts because the only way amazon goes down is if the whole market dips

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-15 14:37:12'] The original play was definitely a bit autistic, but a 20% stop loss? That's genuine retardation. What the fuck were you thinking?
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-15 23:06:20'] Damn dude you missed out on the gains today...
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 12:32:29'] To pile on on what everybody else said, that’s just plain retarded.
	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 13:08:04'] This is fucking retarded. You are betting a $50+ drop by tomorrow. By Monday, your theta will take a huge bite out of the premiums.I knew there was a GUHpedemic but nobody told me how serious it was until I saw people were buying options just before it reaches terminal theta.Correct me if I'm wrong here but this is no longer FDs, buying options 2~3 days from expiry is financial BDSM, you are doing it for the pain inflicted on yourself and the public humiliation

Legit going to fucking off myself now this is retarded.Bid ask is now 4.00/4.15Average cost of $3.45 with 300 contracts you'd be up 18k instead of down 20k if selling at 4.05 (38k swing in a 2-3 hours if you had not gotten stopped out).

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 20:45:43'] I have a hypothesis. WSB has gained some mainstream attention these past few weeks. With large amounts of attention come the possiblilty of manipulation. I think Hyre here know this and is doing a reverse pump and dump. Traders seeing this postion may be taking large positions against this trade. Hyre here has a couple of million to throw around so this trade is just chumming for the sharks. His real postion is in AMZN calls.  He’s posts this supposed YOLO here in hopes of baiting other traders into taking a large postions against him. Which would cause the stock to rise. In which case yea his puts expire worthless but his real trade will set him up for a whole winter of high dollar hookers and boofing cocaine. He’s using the power of autism to pump his real postion up. It’s brilliant but still incredibly stupid if the there no real movement and trade goes sideways.

You’re properly fucked, bud! Wish you would have given me the money instead but oh well.Edit: a quick look at TA and it’s clear that AMZN is due for a bounce. I don’t even know what to say about this. GUHd luck I suppose!

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-14 14:16:00'] No opinion usually on these but the amount of people saying you're an idiot is actually funny. Sure you're paid a load of spread trading this strike but good luck and take the criticism as a greater chance of winning

	COMMENT: ['2019-11-15 08:43:13'] This kind of play is stupid unless you can tolerate the risk. Not being able to tolerate the risk of your position forces you to close it out as soon as it moves against you. I’ve closed out positions for 20% loss because I couldn’t risk the exposure of losing my entire account on a single trade, only to see those options climb 1000% the next day. And doing this with weeklies is maximum autism. If you’re going to throw it all in at least have some theta to spare.

I really don't wish that upon anyone but here is why I can't stand it.It's a lot easier for squeezing up and that's what is going to happen.You deserve the result because no one in their right mind should short Amazon during Christmas.Now if you make money, hey God bless you, but I wanna see this, I'm setting alerts right now to watch Amazon so I know when it's dropping or squeezing up to take your money.I'm also mad at you because with $100,000 you can sell naked otm options every week and just make free money and if you are only into making $1000 - $5000+ per day, then even more stupidly you shorted Amazon instead of trading 10 futures daily to make massive gains on the pump that is happening.But anyway I'm sorry I had to call you out on it.You don't short, you wait for good prices and go long.If you want, sell puts way otm weekly and sell 100 or whatever and let them expire worthless this friday.

Twelve years after its founding, the company introduced the Roomba, a brand that has since become synonymous with the branding, selling more than 30 million units as of 2020.'

	COMMENT: ['2022-02-23 09:28:51'] A second similar way to become a successful sports bettor is to beat line movement and ergo create closing line value. If the consensus line is 3 on an NBA game and a particularly sharp sports book for NBA wagers moves to 2.5, you want to be on the side of the bettors who moved the line by betting +3. Hours later when you see 3 no longer exists anywhere, and the consensus is 2, you can know you made a good bet.How you accomplish this is a more elaborate story, but being on the right side of line movement is key to winning long term.

Still have 3 weeks to end of Q1/22. I'm going add $100 to my DKNG account and place a bet this weekend. Don't expect someone else to do this so your DKNG shares will go up. You will wish you did do this when Q1 comes out and the stock collapse under $10. Would that cost you more than $100? Pass this word around!

And this took many years even after the initial Ryzen processors were onto the market with great results, beating Intel in processing power, efficiency, adaptability, scalability and also cost.Now look to SPCE, what the fuck do they have ? They don’t have shit! Nothing works! How is that comparable to AMD??

Inflation indicators turned hotter in April with consumer spending leading the way. The US economy showed signs of a rebound in last week's ISM report, while global demand remained soft. The Q1 earnings season is coming to an end with results exceeding expectations. However, things may not be as bright under the hood. Regional and small bank pain may not have ended yet, with deposit outflow and commercial real estate being their biggest risks.\n\n# Market-moving News\n\n**The Fed hike 25bp and putting pause on the table.** On Wednesday, the Fed hiked another 25bp, marking the tenth consecutive raise and bringing the benchmark rate to 5-5.25%. This decision pleased both bulls and bears, as JP raised the possibility of a pause in June while emphasizing that the decision would depend "

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:07:53'] > However, EPS were at -7.56 vs the expected 8.49, seeming to lead to the price fall. Considering Amazon's public RIvian holdings, why was this not priced into EPS and a surprise to the ever-efficient market?Probably the same reason why the spike up last earnings was a surprise factoring in RIVN profit. I'm long-term bullish on AMZN and I think in both earnings, the upside and downside were overreactions.

	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:13:05'] In Q4 earnings beat came from RIVN stake and it hasn't been priced into Q1 EPS LOL
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-29 18:28:41'] Don't think the fall had anything to do with rivian it was known long before earnings. F had the same problem still beat and has held up far better than Amazon did .
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 04:43:05'] I’m not necessarily saying I agree, but there are two salient differences between AMZN and F. F had a $6.6B swing, 82% of it was their Rivian loss, and they reaffirmed their prior full year adjusted earnings. AMZN had an $11.9B swing, and a smaller share - 63% of the swing - was due to Rivian. They also forecast uncertain earnings going forward, warning that they could post another loss. The part about Rivian should not have a large per share impact on AMZN - although if you’re not familiar with it, the phenomenon where a parent stock has a bigger drop than the loss in value of the daughter stock - there is a famous example of this involving 3M that’s always brought up in behavioral economics. But the reality is that Rivian has a very small market cap compared to AMZN (not so much compared to F) - diluted on a per share basis that loss is small - even if the entire AMZN investment in Rivian loses its entire value, from here, it ought to only lead to a <1% decline in AMZN’s value. But the market is also forward looking, and if AMZN is going to have increasing difficulty making money on its product sales (vs services) then that’s a bad fundamental for a company that has a really large product footprint. Some of the headlines on Ford were also unfair - they said that Ford was losing money because of its bet on electric - but Ford is doing nicely on sales of their electric vehicles - in the long run, if the Lightning F150 succeeds (and as a former engineer, electric makes so much sense for pickup trucks) then remember how many pickup trucks North Americans buy.
	COMMENT: ['2022-04-30 22:52:15'] I think investors would have wanted to see AMZN without the RIVN impact having made diluted EPS of $15+ on top of stronger retail growth. It was much weaker and I think led to concerns about whether AMZN can sustain the growth needed to justify $3K+.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 14:28:02'] I think it’d be smart for a lot of these closed internet communities (Facebook, Reddit, Instagram etc) to sell data access that isn’t publicly available normally. If the data being trained on was publicly available already then oh well.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 13:01:24'] It’s a land grab pure and simple.  Just because something is public domain doesn’t make it ok to monopolise it.  Knowledge etc is put up in good faith for general consumption of users and shared discussion, not behind closed doors monetisation.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 16:44:22'] Yea, yea...I was trying to find something out once and the chatbot scraped up one of my posts here on Reddit.

	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 19:50:44'] Reddit should share profit with all the content shared on this network, especially tucker Carlson and Alex Jones.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 20:47:30'] Hmmm - there is something to be said about that, because data does have a cost, but there so much cost to compute so it not sure it will bring meaningful roi at the early stages. I think they think their ad revenue generation sucks because of Reddit bits and trying to make up for it
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:29:16'] So an data aggregator social site that doesn't pay for any of the content it allows on here wants to charge AI companies to scrape the same data. They really don't have a means of making money, this is going to tank when it IPO's.
	COMMENT: ['2023-04-18 21:29:25'] No wonder the google CEO is now saying their A.I. is doing stuff it wasn't trained to do. It's like hey lets teach our A.I. to learn off of some message board. What could go wrong.

	COMMENT: ['2023-03-08 22:03:17'] I learned why CDO's exist today.. I have heard that word thrown around in plenty of books and people talking. I never actually spent the time to understand what those dumb little letters actually represent.. let me tell you a story!Have you and your friends ever sat around and had a few beers. Maybe talked about the hot neighbor. Maybe talked about who was most at risk of defaulting on their credit cards and you guys thought it would be fun to gamble which one of you nerds would default first?Ive never considered that before either. Sounds fucking crazy right?Then why the hell are the most sophisticated of people on earth selling the risk of default to each other? I dunno. Could it possibly be that the government in some form or another is actually the one responsible for the payment of your stoned and drunk friends debt?.. who in fact was sensible enough to sell all risk to a friend he supposedly cares about.I have a hard time seeing why anyone who wasn't corrupt would do this...

	COMMENT: ['2021-11-24 23:01:10'] **Money with options is like ice cream near a furnace.....I would ask you to switch to stocks/etf's asap boss, having $2 million dollars with margin to micro/day/swing trade is almost like a unlimited cash dispensing ATM. Since your option adventures are so profitable you have the pulse of the market and its infinitely easier to trade stocks. So what if SPY goes from $470 to even $400 you wait it out for the eventual return to $485 lol. Having the cash to micro trade 4000 shares of SPY is pretty good, slower than options but you are as good as gold or better. I would also save my mental energy by going for two tickers at the maximum, at least for me even one is more tiring than even a full time job, which is why Goldman etc have specialist for each ticker.**

POST_TEXT: b'175 million cars currently runs on BlackBerry QNX blah blah yada yada weve all read a hundred DDs on why BB is going to dominate the EV software market and IVY is gonna collect harvest boatloads of data which BB can sell for a pretty penny. \n\nBut think about it. \n\nLike, wrinkly-brain think about it.\n\nAmazon doesnt build cars or sell car insurance so what the hell do they really want out of this Blackberry partnership?\n\nThe answer is drones. Lots of drones. Our cities will be swarming with delivery drones in the near future, and Amazon needs a way to:\n\n1. Control a vast network of drones that can delivery 2+ billion parcels per year \n\n2. Prevent them from running into other drones/evtols/planes/vehicles \n\n3. Prevent them from being hijacked by hackers and demonstrate to the government that their millions of drones are safe and secure (Blackberry has highest security rating)\n\n4. Collect live data from the drones for package tracking, delivery times estimation , route optimization etc ('
	COMMENT: ['2021-02-11 09:43:20'] At this point Amazon could announce BB will be providing all the support for their drones and as a reward BB share owners will get a free Amazon share for every BB share owner and BB would tank.BB shares just loathe any good news.

Never considered the implications of an autonomous drone fleet....if IVY runs our cars and amzn drones, now just hear me out...would it be possible for them to deliver packages to our cars while they were in motion? like 'poof' drop it through the open sunroof (that IVY opened for you and alerted you that your package was arriving)? I am going to say yes, that could very much be a reality! The future is neat.

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-11 14:58:37'] Okay, AWS is just hosting their services and providing an easy way with its IOT platform for BB to collect data from the cars or devices running BB software. Other than that i don't think aws has any other interest in it and drone software is a far-fetch. Amazon would develop its own analytical platform and don't need BB to do that.&#x200B;Drones might potentially run BB OS but i would doubt that. So your thesis doesn't sound that solid to me honestly.Now, do i have solid info or data on this ? no. but have worked in amazon/aws and relying on that experience to say there's nothing bigger coming of this. Have BB as part of my portfolio too but don't see amazon having a bigger contribution is all

	COMMENT: ['2021-02-11 09:15:19'] There is absolutely no reason to waste that much money on QNX if you’re Amazon. Amazon can develop whatever the hell they want - they already wrote all of their drone software without it.Seriously people don’t understand that Amazon is far more aggressive than Microsoft ever was.You do realize that BB’s current market cap is less than 1/10th of Amazon’s cash on hand right? If Amazon cared that much about the technology - they would simply buy them. Amazon absolutely does not ever let a single company hold that much power over them. So in this case the options are: a) Amazon doesn’t see the BB “partnership” as being much value, or b) BB as a company is still valued too high.

POST_TEXT: b'Hello my good friends, I wish you all good fortunes in the year 2022.\n\nI think you should long $AMZN because Bezos is looking more and more like a super villain each day. And super villains are usually mega-successful financially. Or in movies at least.\n\nAlso his wife left him, so there\'s no reason for him to hold back on pushing the company to the moon anymore. If $AMZN values at $100 trillion tomorrow, no one will come split his fortune from him.\n\nMy last bullish argument is that Jeffee is dismantling a historical bridge for his mega yacht. I view this as very bullish for two reasons: 1) Jeff ain\'t stopping at nothing to get what he wants. Say what you want but the U.S. economy reward those with ambition and aren\'t afraid to hurt others to get what they want; 2) Jeff likes to spend his cash in an "african-american" rich style. To maintain this lifestyle, you\'ve gotta keep them monaaaeyyy coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere you go, three short bullish thesis. Go on and buy some calls on $AMZN. T'

I think 4th quarter and 1st quarter will be fine with supply issues. 2nd quarter maybe it becomes clear how hard they are hit. World largest online retailer is going to feel supply issues.   But remember they do a lot. Cloud hosting is growing exponential. I hear good things about Prime.   Carefull to bet against a behemoth. But yeah. Once supply issues are reflected in earnings stock will go down. Just not yet.  But then again. If you wait too long it's going to be priced in already and puts will be even more expansive. So maybe now is a good time to position yourself.

	COMMENT: ['2021-06-17 06:57:57'] the amount of people who've yolod into Wish without ever actually using it or even reading about it is insane. it's basically just cheap chinese factory shit that failed quality control, sold at the same price as the stuff that didn't fail on Aliexpress. and it takes twice as long to be delivered  Even if it wasn't pure shit, Wish is not a direct competitor to Amazon. Amazon's main selling point is convenience. You want something, it's at your door in 2 days or less. Wish's main selling point is low prices for stuff you don't really need. It's fun to go on Wish when you're drunk and spend £10 on a load of weird shit and then forget about it until they arrive in a couple of months. No one who actually needs anything buys it on Wish. It's like comparing a dollar store to Target or a pound shop to Argos. It might be even worse than that. It might be like comparing gypsy markets you get in town on a Sunday to Argos or Target, except you have to wait 2 months for it to arrive

They refund your original purchase method.I always take time to review my purchases for this reason, and hope others will do the same.Here is a 20” square print on canvas I purchased from them recently.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 00:43:37'] I think WISH is super undervalue from a fundamental perspective. BUt I think the company overall need to make some changes to the quality they sell on their website.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 02:49:10'] You need to break down AMZN down into its segments. AWS and Prime make up the bulk of their profits. E-commerce and warehousing do not make as much but the structure of the business is quite different to WISH. I would say that WISH is disrupting Dollar Tree, Thrift/Novelty shops. Wish has a lot of unique items that you won't find anywhere else.I am very bullish. They utilize customer payments and long shipping times to effectively get free financing for their operations so in the long run they won't need capital to keep the business running. Right now they have a huge marketing spend so you want to watch that along with MAU growth, and perhaps AOV if that info is published.The biggest threat to WISH is not AMZN but BABA. AliExpress sells a lot of similar products, they own Cai Niao which is basically like the global version of Amazon warehouses on steroids. Their goal is to get the majority of packages delivered from the warehouse in China to your door in 72 hours. I have used both Wish and AliExpress recently, and AliExpress had gotten a lot faster, whereas my Wish producs never arrived and I had to apply for a refund.I am long both WISH and BABA, but WISH has a lot in the works (private label through Wish Select, free shipping through Wish Access, etc) which can make them competitive.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 21:36:38'] I think wish gets bought out sooner than later... Imo Honestly could see BABA making an aggressive move. They need a win badly.

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 05:04:16'] WISH is moving!! Should stay on that 🚀🚀 even long term projections $20-$35.. QCOM lost its most profitable partnership, I’m watching that tank played puts last week cause they were cheap expiring 8/6, definitely due to watch a 10% losses overall next 5 trading days easy

	COMMENT: ['2021-08-02 22:01:22'] The quality of dds has severely gone downhill on this sub..now its just people posting random incorrect shit and pumping whatever bag they are holding... amazon is much more than ecommerce, it includes aws, wholefoods, zappos and many other subsidiaries of amazon. Wish on the other hand is a failing ecommerce website that sells crappy low grade products, I don't know a single person that has bought anything from wish.. wish had -$128m net income last quarter,-569m before that.. free cashflow worsened to -354m...its operating at nowhere near profitability or break-even despite being business for 10+ years...unless the company post strong revenues next quarter, the stock is not going anywhere.. The fact that they are competing against amazon is a good enough reason for me to stay away.
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 05:36:03'] People actually buy stuff from Wish? Hahaha
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-03 07:32:45'] Even Cinderella was not treated so badly as Wall-street is treating $Wish in comparison with other e-commerce stock!
	COMMENT: ['2021-08-04 11:59:12'] One day we will all look back to this post and call ourselves dumb fucks for not loading the boat more heavy then it allready is.
